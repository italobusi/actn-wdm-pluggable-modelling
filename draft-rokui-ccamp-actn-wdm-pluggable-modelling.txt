Abstract

   This draft outlines the pluggable module attributes within a host
   device.  It includes representations of optical pluggable module
   capabilities, configuration, states, and telemetry data.  These
   attributes draws from existing IETF standards and incorporates input
   from other industry forums and standards, such as ITU-T, OpenConfig,
   OIF and ONF TAPI, to ensure uniform structuring and consistent naming
   conventions.  Note that the IETF terminology shall be given
   precedence wherever possible.  In case there is a duplication of an
   attribute, this draft may describe how the attribute is named in the
   related document.  Only if no attribute exists in IETF RFCs or IETF
   WG drafts, new attributes shall be introduced if they are needed.

   This draft provides a gap analysis with respect to existing IETF work
   in the following areas:

   *  It provides an analysis of optical attributes provided by other
      organizations and identifying modeling gaps in a few IETF
      documents.

   *  It identifies modeling needs addressing the specific aspect of
      pluggability of transceiver modules.  The authors recognize the
      fact that that not all pluggable modules are coherent, not all
      coherent pluggable modules are DWDM capable and not all DWDM
      capable interfaces are implemented as pluggable modules.  This
      analysis identifies gaps to manage the lifecycle of an optical
      pluggable module, from operator approval and viability assessment,
      to deployment, monitoring and phase-out.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The following terms abbreviations are used in this document:

   *  Optical modules: short term for optical transceiver modules.  Such
      module can be of fixed or pluggable module nature and provides the
      optical interface for communication.

   *  Pluggable modules: short term for pluggable optical transceiver
      module.  Pluggable modules are a specific form of optical modules
      that are field replaceable.  They pro

   *  Coherent module: short term for optical transceiver module
      providing coherent optical modulation capabilities.

   *  DWDM module: short term for coherent module supporting the use of
      a DWDM line system.

   *  Common Management Interface Specification (CMIS): The Common
      Management Interface Specification is an Implementation Agreement
      (IA) developed by the Optical Internet Forum (OIF) [CMIS].  This
      specification defines an interface for managing optical (and
      copper) modules in a standardized way while still permitting
      vendor-specific functionality.  It eases the integration of

      modules supporting the CMIS interface into host platforms from
      different system vendors.  It shall be noted that CMIS targets any
      module, not only coherent optical modules, which is the scope of
      this document.  The CMIS interface is applicable to on-board
      module types (fixed optics) as well as pluggable modules types
      such as QSFP Double-Density (QSFP-DD), OSFP, COBO, QSFP and other
      module types.

   *  optical module media side:

   *  optical module host side:

   *  Monitored attributes: The optical module attributes which can be
      measured, monitored, estimated, or otherwise observed.  The
      monitored attributes are the inputs to performance monitors which
      in turn provide real time samples, threshold crossing supervision,
      and sometimes sample statistics.

2.  Introduction

   Packet traffic has been transmitted across optical networks for many
   years, leveraging the advantages of optical transmission and
   switching combined with packet switching.  Traditionally, Optical
   Line Systems were fully integrated with DWDM Transponder modules in
   proprietary implementations while non-DWDM (aka. client) modules were
   integrated with their hosts.  With the advent of open optical
   networking, also DWDM transponder modules are now hosted by sytems
   outside the Line System.

   In numerous network setups, packet and optical networks have been
   engineered, operated, and managed separately, leading to siloed
   operations that can be suboptimal and inefficient.  Advancements in
   optical component design have led to increased density, enabling
   entire coherent optical terminal systems that previously required
   multiple circuit packs to now fit into a single small form factor
   "coherent optical module."  Integrating coherent optical modules into
   switching and routing devices can result in reduced network costs,
   power consumption, and footprint, while also enhancing data transfer
   rates, reducing latency, and expanding capacity, although in some
   cases, separate packet and optical solutions may still be preferred
   due to other engineering and deployment considerations.

   These trends, coupled with the desire to utilize the best components
   available, have given rise to open optical pluggable modules.
   Communication between optical modules and the host occurs through the
   CMIS standard developed by OIF [CMIS].

   While standardized transmission modes like ZR can handle basic
   applications, proprietary modes from vendors are often necessary to
   achieve optimal performance.

   This draft provides a gap analysis of optical pluggable modules in
   the context of a packet over optical network.  The model presented in
   this document analyzes three key functional blocks:

   *  Photonic/Optical attributes: These attributes defines the
      characteristics of the optical and photonic properties such as
      spectrum, polarization, dispersion etc.

   *  Host/Electrical attributes: These attributes defines the
      characteristics of interconnect between the host and the optical
      pluggable module, such as lane count, FEC etc., which both the
      optical pluggable module and the packet host must understand and
      act upon.

   *  Physical and functional aspects of the pluggable module (i.e.,
      equipment): This defines attributes of the optical pluggable
      module itself, such as plug type, version, thermal
      characteristics, power consumption etc.

   For each of these functional blocks, the model shall provide the
   necessary attributes in following areas:

   *  Capabilities: These attributes are read-only and defines the
      functional capabilities of the optical module.  They are defined
      in a profile called "operational-mode" and contains attributes
      such as modulation, bit-rate, baud-rate, chromatic-dispersion,
      polarization, FEC etc.  An optical module might support one or
      multiple operational-modes.

   *  Configurations: Since an optical module can support multiple
      operational-modes, these read-write attributes configure the
      module to be functional in one of those operational- modes.
      Example of configuration attributes are output power, central
      frequency and operational-mode.

   *  States and performance monitoring telemetry data: These read-only
      attributes will be generated by optical modules and represents
      various states and PM data of the optical modules such as channel
      input power, channel output power, central frequency, laser
      temperature, current OSNR, Link Up/Down State, Alarm State, Laser
      On/Off State etc.  In most cases these attributes are changing
      with time and optical modules report current, average, min and max
      values.  It is also possible to apply thresholds on each of these
      attributes to support threshold crossing alert (TCA).

   Both vendor-agnostic and vendor-specific attributes are important
   considerations in the modeling of optical pluggable modules.

   The document is divided into the following sections:

   *  Section 3: Optical pluggable module in a Device with Packet
      Functions

   *  Section 4: Optical Module Functional Building Block

   *  Section 5: Optical Modules Data Modeling

   *  Section 6: Complete list of Optical Modules Attributes From Google
      Sheet

   *  Section 7: Optical Module Data Modeling Gap Analysis

   *  Section 8: Optical Pluggables Lifecycle Management

3.  Optical pluggable module in a Device with Packet Functions

   Figure 1 shows a host packet device from vendor X, which is connected
   to optical device, equipped with optical pluggable modules from
   vendor X and Y.  This figure exposes the following internal and
   external interfaces:

   A.  This interface provides the control of the host and all it's
   components.  Note that the YANG data model addressing pluggable
   modules will be provided at interface (A), i.e., the management
   interface of the device.  In general the HOST can be any devices
   (packet, OTN etc.)  But in specific this draft addresses this when
   the Host is a packet device.

   B.  The CMIS [CMIS] defines the communication interface between host
   devices and optical modules.

   C.  The data flow between the optical pluggable module and the packet
   data function through this interface.  This is electrical interface
   between optical pluggable module and the host.  Section 4 will
   discuss this in more details.

   D.  Optical fiber connecting the optical devices to optical pluggable
   modules.  This carries the flow of photonic signal from the optical
   device to the optical pluggable modules.  Section 4 will discuss this
   in more details.

   The model presented in Section 5 consolidates properties of optical
   pluggable module on interfaces (D) and (C) in Figure 1 where
   interface (D) provides the photonic/optical attributes and interface

           Figure 1: Packet device with optical pluggable modules

4.  Optical Module Functional Building Blocks

   The functional building blocks of the optical modules of Figure 1 are
   shown in Figure 2 and has three major functions:

   *  Media side: This functional block represents all Photonic/Optical
      attributes of the optical modules (interface (D) in Figure 1).
      These attributes define the characteristics of the optical and
      photonic properties such as spectrum, polarization, dispersion
      etc., which do not directly affect the behavior of the host packet
      device.  Note that the goal of this draft is to identify optical
      module capabilities, configuration, states, and telemetry data
      attributes from existing IETF standards and incorporates input
      from other industry forums and standards, such as ITU-T,
      OpenConfig, OIF and ONF TAPI and then perform the gap analysis to
      compare optical module attributes with current IETF drafts,
      identifying any modeling gaps.  Eventually based on the identified
      gaps, the draft proposes solutions to address missing attributes,
      such as augmenting or updating existing IETF YANG models.  Note
      that IETF terminology are given precedence wherever possible.  In
      case there is a duplication of an attribute, this draft may
      describe how the attribute is named in the related document.  Only
      if no attribute exists in IETF RFCs or IETF WG drafts, new
      attributes shall be introduced if they are needed.

   *  Host side: This functional block represents all Host/Electrical
      attributes of the coherent pluggables (interface (C) in Figure 1).
      These attributes defines the characteristics of interconnect
      between the host and the optical pluggable, such as lane count,
      FEC etc., which both the optical pluggable and the packet host
      should understand and act upon.  Note that the mapping between
      host and media might be one to many, i.e., a host logical channel
      might map to one or more media logical channel.

   *  Equipment attributes: These attributes represent all physical and
      functional aspects of the optical pluggable module such as plug
      type, software version, thermal characteristics, power consumption
      etc.

             Figure 2: Optical pluggable module Building Blocks

   The following sections are describing the details of optical
   pluggable module functional blocks in more details.

4.1.  Optical Channel/OTSi

   The media side of the optical module is further divided into two
   functional blocks; Optical Channel/OTSi and Media Logical Channels.
   The characteristics of the Optical channel/OTSi are (See section
   2.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang] and also
   section 3.2.4 [G.959.1]).

      multiplex structure, in which Ethernet and other types of services
      are mapped

      health of the device, e.g., temperature, voltage, optical
      transmitter/receiver characteristics

   *  Provides for configuration where applicable – e.g., of device
      environmental thresholds

   *  Supports device level capabilities such as firmware installation,
      restarts, etc.

5.1.  optical module Capability Attributes (aka, Supported-Modes)

   Coherent optical modules have revolutionized optical networking by
   offering a powerful combination of high performance, flexibility, and
   ease of deployment.  These modules support a broad range of
   capabilities, making them both efficient and versatile.  Their
   extensive functional capabilities further enhance their effectiveness
   in diverse networking environments.

   From a data modeling perspective, a set of attributes is grouped
   together and represented by a single identifier known as the
   "Operational Mode."  In essence, each operational mode encapsulates a
   combination of properties, limitations and capabilities, such as
   modulation type, bit rate, baud rate, chromatic dispersion,
   polarization, FEC, and more.  Some of these attributes limit value
   ranges (e.g., minimum and maximum).  A optical module can support
   multiple operational modes, each of which can be defined by one of
   the following methods.

   Note that this current draft adheres to the definitions provided in
   draft [I-D.ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang].  See
   Section 2.6 of draft
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang] for:

   *  Standard Mode: This mode pertains to optical specifications
      developed by standards development organizations (SDOs), such as
      the ITU-T recommendation [G.698.2].

   *  Organizational Mode: In this mode, optical interface
      specifications are defined by operators, industry forums (e.g.,
      Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) or OpenConfig), or equipment
      vendors.  This allows for the utilization of optical module
      capabilities that extend beyond existing standards.

   *  Explicit Mode: This mode enables the explicit encoding of any
      subset of parameters (e.g., FEC type, modulation type) to
      facilitate interoperability checks by a controller entity through
      means not covered within this draft.

5.2.  optical module Configurations Attributes

   Referring to Figure 3, optical modules support a set of read-write
   attributes which are configurable.  Example of such configuration
   attributes are output power, central frequency and operational-mode.
   Note that as discussed in Section 5.1, since optical modules may
   support multiple operational-modes, as part of these configuration
   attributes, operator should configure which of these operational-mode
   is desired and should be functional.

5.3.  optical optical module Performance Monitoring Data

   Figure 4 shows the list of optical module Performance Monitoring (PM)
   and state data, which are critical components in optical networks,
   enabling network engineers to ensure optimal performance, identify
   issues, and maintain network reliability.  Operators monitor a range
   of attributes on both the optical/photonic and electrical sides of
   optical modules, including channel input power, channel output power,
   central frequency, current Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio (OSNR), Bit
   Error Rate (BER), chromatic dispersion, laser temperature, link
   status, and more.  These parameters directly impact the quality and
   integrity of the transmitted data across both optical and electrical
   domains.

         Figure 4: Data structure for optical module PM Attributes

   As coherent optical technology continues to gain traction, PM has
   evolved to include more advanced techniques, such as monitoring the
   quality of modulated signals and detecting impairments that could
   degrade performance over long distances.  By leveraging these PM
   capabilities, engineers can ensure that the optical layer operates
   effectively, optimize the utilization of optical resources, and
   maintain high levels of service continuity and performance throughout
   the network.

   It is important to note that the "monitored attributes" encompass
   parameters from the media side, host side, and hardware components of
   optical modules.

   Performance Monitoring (PM) data is generated for various "monitored
   attributes" by optical modules, representing a range of real-time
   metrics, including current, average, minimum, and maximum values, as
   well as counters and states.  The PM data can be categorized as
   follows:

   *  Basic Monitoring PM data: The analogue values which provide the
      "current values" of a "monitored attributes" such as laser
      temperature, eSNR (Effective Signal-to-Noise Ratio) at media
      input, eSNR at host input, laser frequency error, and more.

   *  Advanced Monitoring PM data: The analogue values which provide the
      "current, average, minimum, and maximum values" of "monitored
      attributes" such as transmit signal power, Bit Error Rate (BER),
      chromatic dispersion, etc.

   *  Up Counters: The discrete counter values of "monitored attributes"
      that only increment, such as Bit Error Count, FEC (Forward Error
      Correction) Uncorrected Errors, Loss of Signal (LOS) count, Loss
      of Frame (LOF) count, and others.

   *  Up/Down Counters: The discrete counter values of "monitored
      attributes" that can both incremented and decremented.

   *  Operational/Admin States: Represents the states of "monitored
      attributes" such as link up/down state, alarm state, laser on/off
      state, Automatic Power Control (APC) status, and more.

   For "Up Counters" there might be two approaches:

   *  Continuous Increment: The counter value continuously increments
      without resetting upon read.




Rokui, et al.            Expires 19 January 2026               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   *  Reset on Read: The counter value resets either on read or based on
      a predefined condition.

   For "advanced monitoring performance management (PM) data", where
   current, average, minimum, and maximum values are provided by the
   optical module, a "windowing mechanism" is essential.  Currently,
   this mechanism is implemented by the host platform, not the module
   itself.  For instance, the host platform utilizes the windowing
   mechanism to segment the PM data collected by the optical module.
   Within each window, the host calculates the minimum, maximum, and
   average values of the PM data, enabling a granular and time-specific
   analysis of the module's performance.

   A variety of performance monitoring metrics, including minimum,
   maximum, average, and instantaneous values, can be collected.  These
   metrics offer a comprehensive view of performance fluctuations,
   allowing for precise monitoring and quicker response times to
   anomalies.  Minimum and maximum values help identify the extremes of
   performance, while average values give a sense of typical performance
   levels.  Instantaneous values, on the other hand, provide real-time
   insights, which are crucial for immediate issue detection and
   resolution.  This multi-faceted approach ensures that network
   performance is consistently monitored and maintained at high
   standards.

   Section 5.4 will discuss the collection type and how they are related
   to the above-mentioned PM data.  It also covers the optical modules
   support for threshold crossing alerts (TCA) for all or a subset of
   monitored attributes.

5.4.  optical module Threshold Definition

   As indicated in Section 5.3, optical modules are capable of providing
   the threshold crossing alert (TCA) for all or subset of "monitored
   attributes".  In this situation, the optical module raises an alert
   which informs the host about operationally undesired situations or
   about critical threshold crossings of monitored attributes.  The
   optical module raises an alert by setting an associated Flag on
   module memory-map that represents the alert.

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   As mentioned previously, the TCA might be supported for a subset of
   optical module monitored attributes.  Since it is possible that the
   optical module has different capabilities to raise threshold for
   different monitored attributes, to provide a general solution for
   threshold definition on optical module monitored attributes, this
   draft introduces the concept of "Supported Collection and Threshold
   Group (SCTG)" shown in Figure 5 which defines the configurable
   threshold values and collection types (i.e., the collection of
   current value, average value, min/max value are supported).

   In summary, as outlined in Section 5.3 and Section 5.4, each optical
   module PM/State attribute can have multiple Performance Monitoring
   (PM) values, such as current, average, minimum, and maximum, as well
   as multiple threshold levels, including warning, minor, major, and
   critical.  To streamline this representation in a Google Sheet, each
   optical module PM/State attribute will be associated with a
   corresponding SCTG-Type reference.

   For example, consider the optical module PM attribute "channel-input-
   power."  Tthe optical module collects PM values for current, average,
   minimum, and maximum, while also supporting the configuration of
   threshold values for warning, minor, major, and critical levels.  As
   illustrated in Figure 5, the PM attribute "channel-input-power" is
   linked to "SCTG-Type-1" to simplify its representation in Google
   Sheet.

   To define the warning, minor, major, critical threshold values for a
   optical module monitored attribute, operator should set upper and
   lower limits that delineate acceptable performance ranges.  This
   ensures that any deviations can be quickly identified and addressed.
   A rolling window between min-time and max-time should be employed to
   dynamically adjust these thresholds based on recent data trends,
   providing a more accurate reflection of current network conditions.
   By continuously updating the thresholds, network performance can be
   maintained within optimal parameters, reducing the risk of undetected
   issues.

   Note that sometimes these thresholds are configurable and sometime
   they are hard-coded.  It is also possible that a vendor can support a
   sub-set and super-set of monitored attributes (for super-set they
   need to augment the yang model).

5.5.  optical module Alarm Notifications

   The optical modules might generate various alarm notifications due to
   the various reasons.

   The primary objective is to assess the properties and structures
   within these models that are relevant to coherent optical modules and
   to identify any missing elements or gaps.  The ultimate aim of this
   effort is to ensure that the IETF's work is strategically aligned and
   optimally positioned in relation to broader industry activities and
   standards.

   To support this ongoing analysis, relevant properties and structures
   from both IETF models and external organizations or standards bodies
   are being collected in Google Sheet.  In Section 7, these properties
   will serve as the foundation for conducting a comprehensive gap
   analysis.

   As discussed in Section 5.1, Section 5.2, and Section 5.3, the google
   sheet provides the Capabilities, Configuration, and Performance
   Monitoring attributes for coherent pluggable.  The google sheet
   includes various read-only capability attributes, read-write
   configuration attributes, and read-only performance monitoring
   attributes.  For a comprehensive list of these attributes, refer to
   the accompanying optical module Google Sheet.

   (Q: how can we incorporate the Google Sheet?  Can we use download?

   You can download the Google sheet (/Users/rrokui/Desktop/optical-
   pluggable-attributes-v00-GAP.xslx) to see all the details.

7.  Optical Module Data Modeling Gap Analysis

   [Editorial Note: This section is work in-progress]

   To support gap analysis of optical pluggables in packet-over-optical
   networks, the Google Sheet referenced in Section 6 is utilized.  The
   attributes listed in the sheet are systematically examined to
   determine their applicability to optical pluggables.  For applicable
   attributes, a cross-check is performed to verify whether they are
   included in existing IETF data models.  Attributes not present in the
   IETF models are identified as gaps.  Where necessary, proposals for
   updates or modifications to the IETF models are developed to address
   these gaps or misalignments.

7.1.  List of Missing Optical Pluggable Capability Attributes Based on
      Gap Analysis

   Figure 6 provides the missing capabilities attributes highlights
   important optical pluggable parameters and features that are defined
   by other standards development organizations (SDOs) and industry
   forums, but are currently absent from IETF YANG models.

   Note that the "Attribute Number" refers to numbering in Google Sheet.

   Incorporating these missing capabilities into IETF YANG models would
   significantly enhance the modeling of optical pluggable modules by
   bridging the gap between protocol-level management and physical layer
   specifications.  It would facilitate unified management across
   heterogeneous network elements supporting diverse optical standards
   and proprietary extensions, thereby improving automation, operational
   efficiency, and vendor-neutral interoperability in packet-optical
   networks.  Ultimately, harmonizing these attributes from SDOs and
   forums into IETF models supports the broader goal of open,
   programmable, and interoperable optical networks.

7.4.  Coherent Pluggable Syntax Gaps

   Addressing syntax gaps in coherent pluggable attributes is crucial
   for achieving consistent and interoperable management across
   different implementations.  One key issue lies in establishing a
   standardized naming convention.  There are some naming inconsistency
   on existing IETF drafts
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang],
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis] and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-dwdm-if-param-yang].

   Figure 9 shows a proposal for naming conventiion of optical pluggacle
   attributes.  The current proposal, while illustrative, may need
   further refinement to ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity.
   Specifically, the prefixing of attributes with directions like "tx"
   or "rx" should be consistently applied to all relevant parameters to
   clearly identify the directionality of the signal.  The example also
   shows the need to clearly define the value type associated with the
   attribute, such as min, max, current, or none, for a cohesive and
   standardized approach.  Furthermore, the examples for attribute
   naming need to be universally adopted to establish an attribute
   mapping that is aligned with IETF, improving the overall clarity and
   usability of the YANG models for managing coherent pluggables

   Naming convention:
     direction [tx/rx/both/none]-
     [name of the attribute]-
     value [min / max / current / none]

   Examples:
       for IETF attribute rx-channel-power-max, use
         rx-channel-power-max (no change)

       for ITU-T attribute "Min (residual) chromatic dispersion", use
          residual-chromatic-dispersion-min

       for IETF attribute "max-central-frequency", use
         central-frequency-max

       for IETF attribute "channel-output-power", use
          tx-channel-power

7.5.  Next Steps on Optical Module Data Modeling Gap Analysis

   Based on the results of the gap analysis, the next step will be to
   incorporate the identified pluggable attributes using one of the
   proposed approaches.  It is important to note that this step
   represents the final phase of this draft, and its details will be
   provided in the next version of this draft.

   *  Augmentation of existing IETF YANG data model (e.g. augmentation
      of draft [I-D.ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang])

   *  Extend the content of an existing IETF YANG model via "bis/update"

8.  Optical pluggable modules Lifecycle Management

   [Editorial Note: it is under review.  It was agreed that this section
   is important.  Having said that, there are a few potential solution
   to address this topic:

   *  Keep it is this draft

   *  Talk to author of use-case draft to be included in that draft
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-actn-poi-
      pluggable-usecases-gaps/

   *  Move it to other IETF draft]

   This section discusses the complete lifecycle of an optical pluggable
   module as shown in Figure 10.  It includes discussion on the pre-
   purchase evaluation of pluggable modules through installation to the
   operation of a pluggable module in a live network.

   Most of this lifecycle discussion applies to a majority of equipment
   types.  Where the pluggable module is special, this is highlighted.

   The figure below provides a high level flow.  In a real environment,
   all stages will be running in parallel for various plug versions etc.
   and there may be feedback from any stage to a previous stage.  For
   example, the research, evaluation and planning exercises are ongoing
   activities that continue as the network grows and changes and as new
   pluggable module type & versions are introduced by vendors and
   insight from deployment may feed back to the evaluation stage.

   Throughout the lifecycle specific use cases and scenarios will be
   considered and applied.  These will be developed during the early
   stages and applied in service design.

   Note: The stages and the terminology used are not intended to reflect
   any specific operational practice.  They are intended to be neutral
   with respect to any existing operator's processes, aligning with the
   essence of the processes.

             Figure 10: Lifecycle of a optical pluggable module

   The following sub-sections discuss the overall flow of activities and
   then work through the lifecycle stages in some detail.

8.1.  Approving the pluggable module type and version

   pluggable modules, like all equipment, are carefully chosen.  A
   network operations company (the operator) will decide what pluggable
   modules to use in the network based upon research and an
   understanding of capabilities of the pluggable modules available in
   the marketplace.  These capabilities will be considered against the
   specific applications, use cases and scenarios that are of relevance
   to the operator's business.

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   It is expected that these applications, use cases and scenarios will
   be developed through "Market research" and as pluggable modules etc.
   are assessed.  The use cases and scenarios will be applied
   extensively in later stages.

   The operator will acquire samples of each type & version of pluggable
   module of interest and probably test and then trial them.  They will
   also probably carry out "type approval" considering each type&version
   of pluggable module for a particular set of applications (where those
   applications may be defined by the operator themselves or may be
   standardized definitions) etc.  The full detail of the capability of
   each type & version of pluggable module is relevant at all of these
   stages (see Section 8.5).  The capabilities are expected to be
   expressed in a Repository.

   [Editorial Note: As the main goal of this draft is to identify, we
   might want to move a portion of this section to an annex or separate
   draft].

8.2.  Planning the network

   Specific pluggable modules (type&version) will be purchased only
   after detailed planning of the network.  To carry out this planning,
   full knowledge of each type&version of pluggable module will be
   required.  The planning process will account for key pluggable module
   properties to explore viability and compatibility.  The planning will
   use predictions of "service demand" (e.g., using a demand matrix) and
   hence infrastructure need to determine purchase volumes, phasing etc.

   During the "Network planning" process different types of service
   relevant for the applications, use cases and scenarios (identified in
   Section 8.1) will be explores and specific approaches to realizing
   each resulting type of service will be determined.  This will result
   in design of specific "service realization" patterns and templates
   that will be used in later stages of the process.  The approach to
   deploying each service type is defined for each operational context
   (application etc.)

   As a result of the planning exercise, numbers of each pluggable
   module type&version required will be known and purchasing can be
   initiated.  The purchased pluggable modules will be added to the
   inventory and spares holdings.

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


8.3.  Dealing with service demand

   The planning exercise leads to optical infrastructure requirements
   with some timetable for deployment.  The "Optical infrastructure" is
   designed (using the patterns/templates designed in Section 8.2.  The
   infrastructure will be deployed as appropriate based upon predicted
   and actual service demand etc.

   When optical "services demand" is received, perhaps to provide
   underlay for the packet network or driven by a specific service
   contract, optical network analysis is carried out to evaluate how to
   efficiently and effectively achieve the specific service demanded.
   This analysis will consider the whole optical network including the
   plugs and ROADMs etc.  In most cases this "Service design" will use
   patterns/templates constructed in Section 8.2 in conjunction with
   relevant capability information for the pluggable module
   type&version.

   Prior to progressing further it is important to note that pluggable
   modules are highly valuable, and correspondingly expensive.  They are
   deployed in a controlled fashion.  There are a range of policies for
   deployment of pluggable modules.

   In some cases, at one extreme end of the range of policy choices, an
   operator may decide to fully populate a packet device with a
   selection of pluggable modules and may cable them to adjacent ROADMS.
   However, it is more likely that pluggable module deployment will be
   on a just-in-time basis, at the other end of the range of policy
   choices, so a pluggable module is not deployed (and hence is not
   cabled) until the solution to realization of the optical service has
   been determined.

   Regardless of the deployment approach, the module capability will be
   accounted for in the optical network analysis activity.  Where
   modules are present, the range of installed modules constrain the
   possible realizations, where pluggable module modules have not been
   deployed all approved pluggable module modules (type&version) could
   be considered during the analysis, although capability of the
   relevant packet devices to support specific pluggable module modules
   will also need to be considered, and this may eliminate some
   pluggable module modules.  In addition, if there is some urgency, the
   availability of the type of pluggable modules to the installation
   engineer and/or in the local spares holding inventory may also be
   considered.







Rokui, et al.            Expires 19 January 2026               [Page 34]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   The optical design will be "validated" in terms of "viability" and
   compatibility prior to proceeding.  This analysis takes into account
   the full definitions of the pluggable module type&versions of
   interest, where each is defined in a corresponding and referenced
   Repository.

8.4.  Installing and operationalizing the pluggable module

   Once the design is available, any necessary physical installation
   exercise (pluggable module installation, cabling etc.) is carried
   out, driven by "Work orders" that identify the type&version of
   pluggable module to instal etc.

   On detection of the pluggable module instance, the control system
   will validate that the work order has been carried out correctly.  To
   do this, the full type&version of the pluggable module is read and
   compared with the intent.  Where there are discrepancies, either a
   work order is constructed to correct the installation error after the
   detected pluggable module type&version is evaluated for compatibility
   with the specific design.  This evaluation is done using the
   Repository for that type&version.  It is possible that the
   type&version may be acceptable although perhaps a little more
   expensive than the optimum choice etc.

   Once the type&version of pluggable module has been confirmed, the
   cabling to the pluggable module will be validated and the service set
   up and validated.  Depending upon the operator practices, there may
   be an extensive service test phase prior to handing over the service.
   The service may not be enabled immediately, but will be at some point
   after which the service will become operational.  From this point on,
   normal live service/equipment management/control will be active.

   Beyond this point normal operational activities such as engineering
   works, restoration, upgrade, fault location etc. will be carried out.
   Clearly, there is also the reverse sequence which includes
   deactivating a service and removing the plug and there are also
   various edits and refinements that result from changes in demand and
   changes in understanding of the service needs etc.  These steps have
   not been covered at this stage as the initial list above is
   sufficient to the develop a deep understanding of the control of the
   plugs.  Further stages will be added in a future version of this
   document.

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   In addition, during transition towards a more automated future, there
   are processes related to discovery of existing network etc.  In many
   of these processes the current state of the network is understood
   including the type&version of each pluggable module.  Some degree of
   understanding of capability of pluggable modules (and any other
   equipment) is relevant.

8.5.  Expressing capabilities

   As highlighted above, prior to installation of an optical pluggable
   module in a device, various research, approval, planning and design
   activities must be carried out (as they would be for any hardware).
   All of these activities will require information on the capabilities
   of the pluggable module.

   Detailed information on the capability of the pluggable module is
   required long before it is installed and operating.  This points to
   the need for a model of capability (of a type of pluggable module)
   that is independent of the model of a running instance (and hence
   points to decoupling of the model of capability from the model of the
   operation of the pluggable module).  This also suggest that discovery
   of capability detail from the pluggable module is not sufficient/
   appropriate for deployment (although it may be useful in a lab
   context).

   A machine interpretable definition/specification for the pluggable
   module should be available (independent of the pluggable module
   instance) for each pluggable module type&version where the statement
   of type&version (complete type&version) used is to the degree
   sufficient to precisely identify the relevant (unique) definition/
   specification.  The complete type&version may include hardware
   type&version, firmware type&version and software type&version details
   (where the firmware/software influences the operation/control of the
   pluggable module).  This is essentially the type&version used when
   considering spares holding and like-for-like replacement in the
   field.

   From this perspective, all that is required from a running pluggable
   module is to report the complete type&version detail so that this can
   be confirmed as the right type&version.  The type&version can be used
   to reference the relevant unique specification.

   It is important to clarify the definition of capability.  In this
   document, the term capability means "A quality or facility that
   enables something to carry out some activity and/or take some role".
   In the context of an equipment, the term applies to its functional
   and physical properties.




Rokui, et al.            Expires 19 January 2026               [Page 36]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   Considering a pluggable module (as for many other equipments), this
   would include specification of capabilities such as:

   *  physical size, form factor and shape (the capability to fit in a
      particular type of location)

   *  connector type (the capability to physically interconnect with a
      compatible connector)

   *  bus architecture (the capability to communicate with a compatible
      component)

   *  optical termination characteristics (the functional capabilities
      emergent from the powered physical equipment, allowing
      interconnection with corresponding compatible functions)

   *  measurement opportunities (the functional capabilities to provide
      information to various control functions)

   A capability statement may be a precise single value with no
   uncertainty, a range, a collection of related ranges and thresholds
   etc.  Where some aspect has variability or is controllable, this is
   also required to be specified.

   For an equipment to be understood and used by a control system, the
   detailed information on capabilities must be available in machine
   interpretable form (to the degree necessary for any particular
   function to be carried out).  The machine interpretable statements
   may be in the form of software, but preferably should be in the form
   of data (information) that can be readily ingested by tooling and
   ideally in a standardized language.

   Traditionally, the published statements of capability have been in
   somewhat ambiguous text that require interpretation and conversion
   into a machine interpretable form through a manual intermediate step
   (normally performed, with errors and performed many times for any
   particular device type etc.).  It is suggested here that the best
   source of the machine interpretable data is the specifying authority
   (e.g., ITU-T for standard applications, the vendor for plug
   capabilities, an operator for non-standard applications).

   Within this section, we present a few use-cases showcasing the
   practical application of the coherent pluggable repository.  In this
   section, we present several use cases that demonstrate the practical
   application of coherent pluggable life cycle management.

9.1.  Example-1: Coherent Pluggables Already Provisioned

   The first example is illustrated in Figure 11.  This is a simple
   example where the packet over optical network has been already
   provisioned with both optical underlay and packet overlay services.
   The role of SDN controller is just to discover and manage the
   network.  In other words, the SDN controller was not involved in
   various aspects of service provisioning and viability.  The second
   example will come all these aspects in more detail.

   Within packet devices R1 and R2, coherent pluggables p1 and p2, are
   installed, interfacing through ports port_a and port_b, respectively.
   Both coherent pluggables are provisioned for the following
   operational-mode (see section 3 YANG Model of
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-optical-impairment-topology-yang]):

   *  [organization-identifier, operational-mode] = [OIF, 0x3E]

   A single photonic service is established between these pluggables and
   an IP link is mapped to this L0 photonic service.  The overlay TE-
   Tunnel-1 and L3 service-1 had been also provisioned.  The following
   steps outline the details of how this network is discovered and
   managed by SDN controllers (note that the SDN controller was not
   involved in provisioning):

   *  Packet devices (R1, R2), pluggables (p1, p2), and photonic devices
      (m1, m2, m3) are all discovered by SDN controllers.

   *  The SDN controller also discovers all underlay and overlay
      services, i.e., L0 service-1, IP link-1, TE-Tunnel-1 and L3
      service-1.

   *  The SDN controller has the network inventory, including coherent
      pluggables p1 and p2.  In particular for coherent pluggables,
      basic information such as pluggable type, vendor, manufacturer,
      serial number and software version will be provided by pluggables
      to SDN controller.

   *  The inventory of packet devices R1 and R2 contains the
      configurations of pluggable attributes such as "configured
      operational-mode," "configured central frequency," and "configured
      output power".

   *  Specifically, using the basic information of pluggables p1 and p2
      such as pluggable type, vendor, manufacturer, serial number and
      software version collected earlier from packet devices R1 and R2,
      the SDN controller can use the "Coherent Pluggable Repository," to
      access the entire information of both pluggables p1 and p2.  This
      includes all supported operational-modes along with all attributes
      related to each supported operational-mode.

   *  The SDN controller can collect all PM telemetry data from the
      network (including pluggables).

   *  The SDN controller can collect all alarm notifications from the
      network (including pluggables).

   *  The SDN controller can further change, modify, optimize the
      network (if needed).

9.2.  Example-2: Coherent Pluggables Planning

   The example in Figure 12 demonstrates the usage of the "Coherent
   Pluggable Repository" for entire lifecycle of photonic service from
   including service planning, viability, provisioning, collection of PM
   telemetry, collection of alarm notifications and optimization.

   Note that the packet over optical network in Figure 12 is not created
   yet.  The ports port_a and port_b of packet device R1 and R2 are
   empty and can accept coherent pluggables.  In addition, ports port_a
   and port_b are not connected to the optical network yet, i.e., there
   is no connection between packet devices R1, R2 and optical network.
   The port_a and port_b of packet device R1 and R2 can be potentially
   connected to any photonic nodes m1, m2 or m3.

   Operator's goal is to use the SDN controller to plan, provision and
   monitor an optimal IP link-2 between packet devices R1 and R2.
   Optionally they can also provision overlay TE-Tunnel-2 and L3
   service-2.  To achieve this, the SDN controller should first plan an
   optical service-2, perform the viability to make sure this photonic
   service is feasible, provision it and then map it to an IP link-2.

   operational-modes including all optical and photonic attributes are
   already uploaded to "Coherent Pluggable Repository" by Vendor-X and

   The following steps outline the details of how this network is
   planned, provisioned, discovered and managed by SDN controllers:

   *  At first, there are no coherent pluggables installed in the packet
      devices yet.  There are also no connection between packet devices
      and optical network.

   *  All packet devices (R1, R2) and photonic devices (m1, m2, m3) are
      managed by the SDN controller.

   *  As a result, the SDN controller maintains an inventory of packet
      and photonic devices within the network (i.e., nodes R1, R2, m1,
      m2, m3).

   *  To create the IP link-2, the SDN controller should plan and then
      provision the optical service-2 between port_a and port_b.

   *  To this end, the SDN controller should first design an optical
      service and then performs the viability check to make sure the
      optical service is viable in this network.

   *  So, the SDN controller calculates the best optical path from
      port_a to port_b.

   *  Next, the SDN controller performs the viability on optical route
      to make sure the optical path is viable in the network.

   *  To do viability, the SDN controller checks all attributes of all
      operational-modes to find the most optimal operational-mode.  To
      do this, the SDN controller connects to the "Coherent Pluggable
      Repository" and access all optical and photonic attributes of all
      operational-modes (such as chromatic dispersion, FEC, modulation,
      polarization mode dispersion etc.) and performs the viability.

   *  After performing the optical path calculation and optical
      viability, the SDN controller selects the best coherent pluggable
      to be installed on port_a and port_b and the best optical route
      from port_a to port_b.

   *  Upon completion of the photonic viability check, the SDN
      controller determines which photonic devices (m1, m2, m3) should
      be connected to ports port_a and port_b.

   *  The SDN controller informs the operator of the selected coherent
      pluggables for ports port_a and port_b and provides instructions
      on how to connect them to the respective photonic devices (m1, m2,
      m3).

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   *  The operator installs the designated pluggables into ports port_a
      and port_b and connects them to the specified photonic devices.

   *  The SDN controller then manages the newly installed pluggables.

   *  As part of the photonic viability process, the SDN controller
      knows the specific attributes of the pluggables, including
      "configured operational mode," "configured central frequency," and
      "configured output power."

   *  As a result, the SDN controller configures these configurations to
      each pluggable on port_a and port_b

   *  The SDN controller should also configure optical nodes m1, m2, m3
      with attributes such as output power.

   *  The SDN controller provisions the optical service_1 between two
      coherent pluggables on port_a and port_b.

   *  The SDN controller also provisions the IP link-2 between packet
      device R1 and R2.

   *  The SDN controller can collect all PM telemetry data from the
      network (including pluggables).

   *  The SDN controller can collect all alarm notifications from the
      network (including pluggables).

   *  The SDN controller can further change, modify, optimize the
      network (if needed).

10.  Appendix B - Support of Opaque Attributes

   [Editorial Note: This section in under review.  The GihHub issue #14
   addresses this].

   In certain cases, a coherent pluggable may support attributes that
   are specific to a particular vendor.  This draft refers to such
   attributes as "Opaque Attributes".  Given that coherent pluggables
   encompass capability, configuration, and performance monitoring
   (PM)/state attributes, each category may contain opaque attributes.
   Consequently, the opaque attributes could include the following:

   *  Read-only opaque capability attributes

   *  Read-write opaque configuration attributes

   *  Read-only opaque PM/state attributes



Rokui, et al.            Expires 19 January 2026               [Page 43]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   As part of coherent pluggable work, we need to address this situation
   where a coherent pluggable contains some proprietary capability,
   configuration and PM/states attributes which are needed to be
   configured or accessed from coherent pluggables.  In this situation
   we need to address how opaque attributes are treated by packet device
   host.  This allows different coherent pluggables to be used in
   various multi-vendor hosts in plug-and-play fashion.

   It is important to note that "opaque attributes" are not simply
   attributes that can be addressed through augmentation of the YANG
   data model.  The reason for this is that the coherent pluggable is
   exposed to external systems via the host packet device northbound
   interface as shown in Figure 1.  If the host packet device does not
   recognize any of these "opaque attributes". it may prevent the
   discovery of the coherent pluggable.

   When such opaque attributes exist, although the host packet device
   may not comprehend the semantics of these opaque attributes, it
   should function as a proxy and mediator between the coherent
   pluggable and the northbound SDN controller.  Specifically, the host
   packet device should understand the syntax of the opaque attributes
   and facilitate communication between the coherent pluggable and the
   northbound SDN controller.  To achieve plug-and-play functionality in
   a multi-vendor environment, the host packet device should be capable
   of supporting these opaque attributes.  The rest of this section will
   provide details on how to achieve this.

   Another consideration is the privacy of opaque attributes, i.e.,
   there are situations where these attributes may be commercially
   sensitive.  In these cases, it would be reasonable to assume that the
   opaque attributes are in encrypted format allowing them to be passed
   from coherent pluggable to northbound of the host without being
   observed or interpreted in any way by host.

   To achieve this, the coherent pluggable YANG data model (the work
   done as part of this draft - Google Sheet) should first be augmented
   with vendor proprietary capability, configuration or PM attributes.
   As noted above, it might be also necessary to define how these new
   attributes are mapped to the internal protocol between the host and
   the pluggable via CMIS protocol.  A key consideration is that the
   host does not need to understand the semantics of these new
   attributes and may not even need to know their syntax.

   There are multiple solutions to this problem which will be discussed
   below.  To demonstrate these solutions, consider the host Vendor-X
   and pluggable Vendor-Y in Figure 1.  Let's assume:





Rokui, et al.            Expires 19 January 2026               [Page 44]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   *  Vendor-Y has a new read-write proprietary configuration attributes
      "AA" which should be configured in pluggable (in addition to well-
      known attributes such as central-frequency, power and operational-
      mode).  The value of attribute AA is 100 and its memory map in
      coherent pluggable is 0x1100.

   *  In addition, consider a new read-only proprietary capability
      attributes "CC" supported on pluggable in range of {CC-min, CC-
      max}={1.1,3.3}.

10.1.  Support of Opaque Capability Attributes

   The coherent pluggable YANG data model is augmented with a list of
   new capability attributes.  As demonstrated in Figure 13, the YANG
   data model is augmented with the following information:

   *  ID of new capability proprietary attribute

   *  Name of new capability proprietary attribute

   *  Minimum value of new attribute

   *  Maximum value of new attribute

   The Figure 13 shows an example of new capability attribute "CC" whose
   min and max values are 1.1 and 3.3, respectively.

10.3.  Support of Opaque Configuration Attributes (Solution-1)

   To support the opaque configuration attributes, there are a few
   potential solutions which are discussed below.  This approach is the
   simplest solution, as it requires no interpretation by the host
   platform.  The coherent pluggable YANG data model is augmented with a
   list that directly maps the values of new configuration attributes to
   the corresponding memory-map locations on the pluggable device.  In
   this solution, the memory-map locations must be known to the
   operator, potentially provided in the Coherent Pluggable Repository.
   The Figure 14 illustrates the coherent pluggable YANG data model,
   which has been augmented with the following information:

   *  ID of new proprietary configuration attribute

   *  Name of new proprietary configuration attribute

   *  Value of new proprietary attribute

   *  The memory map of new proprietary attribute (which is used in CMIS
      communication between host and pluggable)

   For instance, consider a scenario where the operator intends to
   configure a new proprietary attribute, "AA," with a value of 100, and
   a memory-map location on the pluggable set to 0x1100.  In this
   process, the host platform receives the attribute "AA" as defined in
   Figure 14.  The host platform then relays this information to the
   coherent pluggable via the CMIS protocol, without performing any
   interpretation.  In other words, the host platform is not required to
   understand the syntax or semantics of these attributes; it functions
   merely as a conduit, transmitting the values from the NBI to the
   designated memory-map locations on the pluggable.

10.4.  Support of Opaque Configuration Attributes (Solution-2)

   This approach is similar to Figure 14 but requires the host platform
   to implement lookup logic to determine the memory-map location on the
   pluggables.  In this solution, the coherent pluggable YANG data model
   is augmented with the following new attributes, as shown in
   Figure 15:

   *  ID of new proprietary configuration attribute

   *  Name of new proprietary configuration attribute

   *  Value of new proprietary attribute

   The operator does not have visibility into the specific memory-map
   locations for these attributes on the coherent pluggable device.
   Instead, the memory-map for each new attribute is provided in the
   Coherent Pluggable Repository.  In this scenario, the host platform
   must search the pluggable Repository to locate the corresponding
   memory-map location for each new attribute.  These values are then
   communicated to the pluggable via the CMIS protocol for
   configuration.  As in Figure 14, the host platform does not need to
   understand the syntax or semantics of the new attributes; it only
   needs to search the pluggable Repository to identify the memory-map
   locations for the new attributes.

   As illustrated in Figure 15, the host platform receives the new
   attribute "AA" via its Northbound Interface (NBI), with a
   configuration value of 0x1100.  The host then searches the coherent
   pluggable Repository to determine the memory-map location associated
   with this attribute and identifies it as 0x1100.  Without
   interpreting the attribute's syntax or semantics, the host platform
   communicates this information to the coherent pluggable via the CMIS
   protocol.  Essentially, the host platform functions as a proxy,
   transmitting the values from the NBI to the appropriate memory-map
   locations on the pluggable without needing to understand the meaning
   of the attributes.

   </opaque-config-attribute-list>

       Figure 15: Solution-2 for support of opaque config attributes

10.5.  Support of Opaque Configuration Attributes (Solution-3)

   This solution represents an advanced approach when a new opaque
   configuration attribute is mapped to multiple memory-map locations on
   a pluggable device, or when multiple such attributes are mapped to a
   single memory-map location on pluggable.  Similar to Figure 15, the
   mapping between these new attributes and their corresponding memory-
   map locations should be detailed in the pluggable Repository.  For
   each new opaque attribute, the host platform is required to perform a
   lookup in the pluggable Repository to identify the relevant memory-
   map locations.  The platform then assembles the corresponding values,
   which are communicated to the pluggable device via the CMIS protocol.

   Although this solution is included for completeness, it is not
   practical or desirable due to its complexity and the need for
   interpretation by the host software

10.6.  Support of Opaque Secret Configuration Attributes

   There are situations where opaque configuration attributes are
   confidential, and the vendor wishes to conceal their meanings and
   values.  When considering the interface from the pluggable device to
   the host via CMIS, it is crucial that the pluggable does not expose
   the meaning or value of these confidential attributes.  Ideally, the
   pluggable device would encrypt the data.  Within the context of CMIS,
   it may be sufficient to allocate an array of register locations to
   convey the property values.  These registers would store an encrypted
   data blob for read-only properties and accept an encrypted blob for
   writable registers.  The specific value might be set or read through
   different register positions on each read/write, depending on the
   encryption technique used.





Rokui, et al.            Expires 19 January 2026               [Page 48]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   It is important to note that since the pluggable device encrypts the
   data, mapping the data offers no additional benefit.  The YANG model
   would simply convey the register values as requested.  The properties
   are applied to the memory map in a manner that may appear disordered.
   The location values must always be read together and written as
   specified, potentially requiring multiple reads to retrieve all
   properties.  This approach could be incorporated into the basic
   register-based option discussed in Section 10.3.

   As an example, let's assume a vendor defines secret attribute "DD"
   for its coherent pluggable.  Vendor first needs to augment IETF data
   model with a list of encrypted values and memory-maps shown in
   Figure 16.  This very similar to Figure 14 where essentially the host
   functions as a proxy, transmitting the values from the NBI to the
   appropriate memory-map locations on the pluggable without needing to
   understand the meaning and semantics of these attributes.

10.7.  Support of Opaque Performance Monitoring Data

   The host packet device is informed of the properties via YANG
   augments and appropriate mapping definitions.  The mapping
   definitions tell the host that the related properties are related to
   performance monitoring data such that the host will periodically read
   the appropriate parts of the pluggable interface as for any other
   performance monitoring data.  AS for all other performance monitoring
   data, the host does not need to understand the data.  The client
   controller can carry out analysis or can propagate the measures
   transparently to some other controller etc.

   Referring to Section 5.1, the coherent pluggable capability
   attributes (i.e., supported-modes) are crucial aspects of coherent
   pluggables and should be easily accessible for various reasons and
   activities.  Those might include:

   *  Network Engineers: Network engineers needs to know the
      capabilities and characteristics of any coherent pluggable whether
      the coherent pluggable is already deployed or will potentially be
      installed and deployed in their network

   *  SDN Controllers: The optical, packet or higher-layer SDN
      controllers need to have detailed knowledge of the coherent
      pluggables for various reasons such as network planning, viability
      assessment of the photonic services from plug-to-plug,
      configuration and performance monitoring collection, alarm
      notifications etc.

   *  Packet Device (e.g., Router): Optionally the host packet device
      need also access to coherent pluggable capabilities to provide
      details of coherent pluggables already installed in packet devices
      for example during the debugging and troubleshooting of
      pluggables.

   To facilitate the utilization of coherent pluggable attributes, this
   draft introduces the concept of the "Coherent Pluggable Repository"
   The term serves as a comprehensive collection of information that is
   appropriately structured and interrelated, providing a detailed
   description of the capabilities of a pluggable device.  In
   alternative terminology, the Coherent Pluggable Repository may also
   be referred to as a Specification, a Profile, or a Plug database,
   among other terms.

   It should be noted that any equipment could have a repository
   describing its capabilities and it may be broken down into units that
   can be referenced and reused, i.e., the definition can be modular.
   To facilitate the stages, each vendor would be expected to provide
   this information for each pluggable type & version.

   A pluggable type & version may offer a subset of standard
   capabilities.  The subset is described by simply omitting
   definitions.

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   A pluggable type & version may offer a super-set.  The super-set is
   detailed by adding definitions via "augmentation" to the set of
   standard definitions available for use in the Coherent Pluggable
   Repository.  These capability augmentations relate to augmentations
   to the YANG model used at the interface to the host.  Note that host
   has no need to understand the semantics of the augmented properties,
   but does need to know the mapping to the pluggable interface.  This
   is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this document.

   We should also consider the fact that some proprietary attributes and
   capabilities of the coherent pluggable might be commercially
   sensitive and hence confidential and a vendor might not want to
   provide it to publicly to everyone.  In other words, some guidelines
   and restriction might be applicable to some portion of "Coherent
   Pluggable Repository".  To provide more security, the access to the
   pluggable Repository could be restricted or password protected and
   potentially encrypted.  It is also possible to provided restrict
   access to an operator or a team or group of people of an operator
   where there may also be a requirement for an NDA to enable access to
   the data.  It is also possible that the encrypted section of the
   Repository might only be passed to a specific vendor control
   component (without being meaningfully observed by other control
   components from other vendors).  The encrypted information may be
   passed via a special secure channel directly to a component
   authorized to decrypt the information into machine interpretable form
   and use it.

   Considering the above, it appears reasonable that all pluggable
   capabilities whether they be proprietary or standard should be fully
   described in the Repository (considering that some portions of the
   Repository might have restrictions as previously described).  This
   may be achieved by a reference to a standard that is itself fully
   defined in machine interpretable form.  This approach would allow for
   a far more flexible and future-proofed control solution.

   In summary, to facilitate easy access to coherent pluggable
   attributes, the details of coherent pluggable operational-modes are
   collected in a repository (access restriction might be applicable to
   some portions of this document), such as GitHub and SharePoint,
   called "Coherent Pluggable Repository".  The Repository must be both
   human and machine-readable repository and can be read and interpreted
   easily by any SDN controller, operators, or other devices in the
   network.  A Repository contains multiple records which are uniquely
   identified by tuple [organization-identifier, operational-mode].

   The Coherent Pluggable Repository contains four sections:

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             July 2025


   *  Photonic/Optical capability section: This section contains all
      photonic/optical capabilities of the coherent pluggable and
      identifies all read-only attributes.  It also allow augmentation
      of this section for vendor-specific attributes.

   *  Configuration attributes: This section contains all read-writer
      attributes which can be configured on coherent pluggable.  It also
      allow augmentation of this section for vendor-specific
      configuration attributes.

   *  PM Collection style for monitored attributes: List of all read-
      only monitored attributes where the coherent pluggable can collect
      PM data.  This section identifies if the collection of current,
      average, min and max values are possible.

   *  PM Threshold values: For all or a subset of read-only monitored
      attributes, this section contains the threshold settings for
      threshold crossing alerts (TCA) if applicable.

   Figure 17 illustrates the overall structure of the "Coherent
   Pluggable Repository".  It contains several operational-mode records
   where each record includes all the capability attributes for tuple
   [organization-identifier, operational-mode].  As discussed in
   Section 5.1, "organization-identifier" refers to any authority that
   defines these attributes.

   Each record in the coherent pluggable Repository is machine readable/
   interpretable and is uniquely identified by a tuple [organization-
   identifier, operational-mode].

   Using "Coherent Pluggable Repository", the format of all operational-
   modes are identical whether it is defined by for example ITU-T, OIF,
   OpenConfig, or defined by a vendor.

      tuple [organization-identifier, operational-mode]

   Below are several examples that demonstrate the concept of the
   "Coherent Pluggable Repository."  Figure 18 illustrates the content
   of a Repository record for operational mode 0x3E, as defined by the
   OIF forum.  This operational mode is widely recognized and supported
   by nearly all coherent pluggable devices.  Detailed information
   regarding this operational mode can be found in [SFF8024], Table 4-7.

          Figure 18: Coherent Pluggable repository Defined by OIF

   Figure 19 is anther repository record where the Vendor-X has defined
   the operational-mode 0x22.  In this case, Vendor-X defines all the
   attributes related to this operational-mode, which might not be
   supported by other pluggable vendors.

   organization-identifier: Vendor-X
   operational-mode: 0x22
   // Photonic/Optical capabilities attributes
   list of attributes
         modulation: 16-QAM
         bit-rate: 400 Gbps
         baud-rate: 56 GBd
         more attributes ...
   // Configuration attributes
   // Monitored attributes PM collection
   // Monitored attributes Threshold setting

             Figure 19: Coherent Pluggable repository Example-2

   "Figure 20" presents an example where the Vendor-Y defined an
   operational-mode 0x22 as well.  In this scenario, the organization
   associated with the pluggable module is Vendor-Y, which defined the
   same operational-mode 0x22 as "Vendor-X"

   It is important to note that while the operational-modes in both
   Figure 19 and Figure 20 share the same values, they are defined by
   different vendors.  Consequently, these operational-modes are not

   related and may differ significantly in their attributes.  In other
   words, although the semantics of these modes are identical, their
   actual content might vary significantly.  This is one of the reasons
   that any record in Coherent Pluggable Repository is uniquely
   identified by tuple [organization-identifier, operational-mode].
