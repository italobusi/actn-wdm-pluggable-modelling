Introduction\r\n\r\n   Packet traffic has been transmitted across optical networks for many\r\n   years, leveraging the advantages of optical transmission and\r\n   switching combined with packet switching.  Traditionally, optical\r\n   systems and packet systems have been distinct, each with their own\r\n   dedicated devices.\r\n\r\n   In numerous network setups, packet and optical networks have been\r\n   engineered, operated, and managed separately, leading to siloed\r\n   operations that can be suboptimal and inefficient.  The evolution of\r\n   both packet and optical systems has largely been independent.\r\n   Optical systems, in particular, have seen advancements in capacity,\r\n   especially with the adoption of coherent optical techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRokui, et al.            Expires 27 August 2024                 [Page 3]\r\n\f\r\nInternet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables         February 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n   Advancements in optical component design have led to increased\r\n   density, enabling entire coherent optical terminal systems that\r\n   previously required multiple circuit packs to now fit into a single\r\n   small form factor \"coherent pluggable.\"  Integrating coherent\r\n   pluggables into devices with packet functions can result in reduced\r\n   network costs, power consumption, and footprint, while also enhancing\r\n   data transfer rates, reducing latency, and expanding capacity,\r\n   although in some cases, separate packet and optical solutions may\r\n   still be preferred due to other engineering and deployment\r\n   considerations.\r\n\r\n   These trends, coupled with the desire to utilize the best components\r\n   available, have given rise to open optical pluggables.  These\r\n   pluggables allow a plug from one vendor to be installed in a device\r\n   from another vendor with packet functions.  Communication between\r\n   coherent pluggables and the packet device host occurs through the\r\n   CMIS standard developed by OIF [OIF-CMIS].\r\n\r\n   While standardized transmission modes like ZR can handle basic\r\n   applications, proprietary modes from vendors are often necessary to\r\n   achieve optimal performance.\r\n\r\n   This draft outlines the modeling of an optical pluggable within a\r\n   host packet device within the context of a packet over optical\r\n   network.  The model presented in this document consolidates various\r\n   properties of optical pluggables into three key areas:\r\n\r\n   *  Optical media interface: This defines the characteristics of the\r\n      optical solution such as spectrum, polarization, and dispersion,\r\n      which do not directly affect the behavior of the host packet\r\n      device.\r\n\r\n   *  Electrical plug-to-host interconnect: This defines the\r\n      characteristics of the bus interconnect between the host and the\r\n      plug, such as lane count and FEC, which both the optical pluggable\r\n      and the packet host must understand and act upon.\r\n\r\n   *  Physical and functional aspects of the pluggable: This defines\r\n      attributes of the optical pluggable itself, such as plug type,\r\n      version, thermal characteristics, and power consumption, which\r\n      indirectly affect the packet host.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRokui, et al.

Capabilities are defined in profiles related to operational\r\n   modes, with some capabilities potentially being proprietary\r\n   Configurations include attributes for optical settings, monitoring\r\n   capabilities, and test capabilities, while state and telemetry data\r\n   include dynamic properties such as performance monitoring collections\r\n   and alarm notifications.\r\n\r\n   Both vendor-agnostic and vendor-specific attributes are important\r\n   considerations in the modeling of coherent pluggables.\r\n\r\n   The document is divided into the following sections:\r\n\r\n   *  Section 3: Packet over optical converged network context\r\n\r\n   *  Section 4: Coherent Pluggables Building Blocks\r\n\r\n   *  Section 5: Coherent Pluggables Data Modeling\r\n\r\n   *  Section 6: Coherent Pluggables Yang Model\r\n\r\n3.

This is the new proposed text.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------\r\nThis draft outlines the optical pluggable attributes within a host packet device, focusing on their role in a packet-over-optical network. It includes representations of coherent pluggable capabilities, configuration, states, and telemetry data. These attributes draws from existing IETF standards and incorporates input from other industry forums and standards, such as ITU-T, OpenConfig, OIF and ONF TAPI, to ensure uniform structuring and consistent naming conventions. Note that the IETF terminology shall be given precedence wherever possible. In case there is a duplication of an attribute, this draft may describe how the attribute is named in the related document. Only if no attribute exists in IETF RFCs or IETF WG drafts, new attributes shall be introduced if they are needed.\r\n\r\nA gap analysis is included to compare optical pluggable attributes with current IETF drafts, identifying any modeling gaps. Based on the identified gaps, the draft proposes solutions to address missing attributes, such as augmenting or updating existing IETF YANG models.\r\n\r\nThe lifecycle of an optical pluggable, from operator approval and viability assessment to deployment and monitoring, is also addressed.\r\n\r\n[Editor's note: This may be covered in a separate document, currently under investigation.] Additionally, this draft introduces the concept of a \"Coherent Pluggable Repository\", which maintains a repository of pluggable capabilities. It also includes a gap analysis of coherent pluggable attributes in existing IETF drafts and other SDOs, providing a comprehensive view of the lifecycle of a coherent pluggable, from operator approval through to deployment",

To streamline this representation in a Google Sheet, each\r\n   optical pluggable PM/State attribute will be associated with a\r\n   corresponding SCTG-Type reference.\r\n\r\n   For example, consider the coherent pluggable PM attribute \"channel-\r\n   input-power.\"  Tthe optical pluggable collects PM values for current,\r\n   average, minimum, and maximum, while also supporting the\r\n   configuration of threshold values for warning, minor, major, and\r\n   critical levels.  As illustrated in Figure 5, the PM attribute\r\n   \"channel-input-power\" is linked to \"SCTG-Type-1\" to simplify its\r\n   representation in Google Sheet.\r\n",

I.e. the optical description is not dependent whether a module is pluggable or not. I suggested a terminology definition.\r\n2) a gap analysis is supposed to identify gaps between what there is (i.e. existing IETF work) and some other reference (i.e. OIF). FOr optical parameters, it is clear that the gap is in between IETF-topology/ietf-DWDM-if and other standards (as identified in our google doc). In much of the rest it is unclear between which documents the gap appears to exist. i.e. is there a gap between remote inventory drafts and what is desired for pluggable modules?\r\n3) The text delves into specific controller architectures, but the scope of the draft is about (pluggable) modules themselves. It would be better to keep these aspects in different drafts.",

The authors recognize the fact that that not all pluggable modules are coherent, not all coherent pluggable modules are DWDM capable and not all DWDM capable interfaces are implemented as pluggable modules. This analysis identifies gaps to manage the lifecycle of an optical pluggable module, from operator approval and viability assessment, to deployment, monitoring and phase-out.\r\n\r\n> [Editor's note: Solutions for the pluggable aspect may be covered in a separate document, currently under investigation.] \r\n> [Editor's note: The lifecycle of pluggable modules may be covered in a separate document, currently under investigation.] \r\n",
