Introduction\r\n\r\n   Packet traffic has been transmitted across optical networks for many\r\n   years, leveraging the advantages of optical transmission and\r\n   switching combined with packet switching.  Traditionally, optical\r\n   systems and packet systems have been distinct, each with their own\r\n   dedicated devices.\r\n\r\n   In numerous network setups, packet and optical networks have been\r\n   engineered, operated, and managed separately, leading to siloed\r\n   operations that can be suboptimal and inefficient.  The evolution of\r\n   both packet and optical systems has largely been independent.\r\n   Optical systems, in particular, have seen advancements in capacity,\r\n   especially with the adoption of coherent optical techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRokui, et al.            Expires 27 August 2024                 [Page 3]\r\n\f\r\nInternet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables         February 2024\r\n\r\n\r\n   Advancements in optical component design have led to increased\r\n   density, enabling entire coherent optical terminal systems that\r\n   previously required multiple circuit packs to now fit into a single\r\n   small form factor \"coherent pluggable.\"  Integrating coherent\r\n   pluggables into devices with packet functions can result in reduced\r\n   network costs, power consumption, and footprint, while also enhancing\r\n   data transfer rates, reducing latency, and expanding capacity,\r\n   although in some cases, separate packet and optical solutions may\r\n   still be preferred due to other engineering and deployment\r\n   considerations.\r\n\r\n   These trends, coupled with the desire to utilize the best components\r\n   available, have given rise to open optical pluggables.  These\r\n   pluggables allow a plug from one vendor to be installed in a device\r\n   from another vendor with packet functions.  Communication between\r\n   coherent pluggables and the packet device host occurs through the\r\n   CMIS standard developed by OIF [OIF-CMIS].\r\n\r\n   While standardized transmission modes like ZR can handle basic\r\n   applications, proprietary modes from vendors are often necessary to\r\n   achieve optimal performance.\r\n\r\n   This draft outlines the modeling of an optical pluggable within a\r\n   host packet device within the context of a packet over optical\r\n   network.  The model presented in this document consolidates various\r\n   properties of optical pluggables into three key areas:\r\n\r\n   *  Optical media interface: This defines the characteristics of the\r\n      optical solution such as spectrum, polarization, and dispersion,\r\n      which do not directly affect the behavior of the host packet\r\n      device.\r\n\r\n   *  Electrical plug-to-host interconnect: This defines the\r\n      characteristics of the bus interconnect between the host and the\r\n      plug, such as lane count and FEC, which both the optical pluggable\r\n      and the packet host must understand and act upon.\r\n\r\n   *  Physical and functional aspects of the pluggable: This defines\r\n      attributes of the optical pluggable itself, such as plug type,\r\n      version, thermal characteristics, and power consumption, which\r\n      indirectly affect the packet host.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRokui, et al.

Capabilities are defined in profiles related to operational\r\n   modes, with some capabilities potentially being proprietary\r\n   Configurations include attributes for optical settings, monitoring\r\n   capabilities, and test capabilities, while state and telemetry data\r\n   include dynamic properties such as performance monitoring collections\r\n   and alarm notifications.\r\n\r\n   Both vendor-agnostic and vendor-specific attributes are important\r\n   considerations in the modeling of coherent pluggables.\r\n\r\n   The document is divided into the following sections:\r\n\r\n   *  Section 3: Packet over optical converged network context\r\n\r\n   *  Section 4: Coherent Pluggables Building Blocks\r\n\r\n   *  Section 5: Coherent Pluggables Data Modeling\r\n\r\n   *  Section 6: Coherent Pluggables Yang Model\r\n\r\n3.
