     Modelling of Optical Pluggables in Packet Over Optical Network
           draft-rokui-ccamp-actn-wdm-pluggable-modelling-00

Abstract

   This draft outlines the modeling of optical pluggables within a host
   packet device in the context of a packet over optical network.  The
   model encompasses all pertinent properties of the pluggable for
   various packet over optical use cases and is partitioned into three
   primary areas: the optical media interface, the electrical plug to
   host interconnect, and the physical equipment of the pluggable.

   Included in the model are representations of configuration, states,
   and telemetry data, as well as of profiles and coherent plug
   capabilities.  Emphasizing the importance of considering both vendor-
   agnostic and vendor-specific attributes in modeling coherent
   pluggables.

   Drawing from existing models in IETF, OpenConfig, ITU-T, OIF, and
   TAPI, this model offers enhanced uniform structuring and naming.
   Additionally, it provides insight into the mapping to plug interface
   structures defined in CMIS.

   This draft introduces the concpet of "Coherent Pluggable Manifest",
   where a represents the capabilities of a type&version of pluggable,
   maintained in a public repository of all pluggables.  This document
   also covers gap analysis of current IETF drafts and other SDOs on
   coherent pluggables attributes and provides the complete lifecycle of
   a coherent pluggable from operators' approval through viability
   assessment to deployment.

2.  Introduction

   Packet traffic has been transmitted across optical networks for many
   years, leveraging the advantages of optical transmission and
   switching combined with packet switching.  Traditionally, optical
   systems and packet systems have been distinct, each with their own
   dedicated devices.

   In numerous network setups, packet and optical networks have been
   engineered, operated, and managed separately, leading to siloed
   operations that can be suboptimal and inefficient.  The evolution of
   both packet and optical systems has largely been independent.
   Optical systems, in particular, have seen advancements in capacity,
   especially with the adoption of coherent optical techniques.

   Advancements in optical component design have led to increased
   density, enabling entire coherent optical terminal systems that
   previously required multiple circuit packs to now fit into a single
   small form factor "coherent pluggable."  Integrating coherent
   pluggables into devices with packet functions can result in reduced
   network costs, power consumption, and footprint, while also enhancing

   data transfer rates, reducing latency, and expanding capacity,
   although in some cases, separate packet and optical solutions may
   still be preferred due to other engineering and deployment
   considerations.

   These trends, coupled with the desire to utilize the best components
   available, have given rise to open optical pluggables.  These
   pluggables allow a plug from one vendor to be installed in a device
   from another vendor with packet functions.  Communication between
   coherent pluggables and the packet device host occurs through the
   CMIS standard developed by OIF [OIF-CMIS].

   While standardized transmission modes like ZR can handle basic
   applications, proprietary modes from vendors are often necessary to
   achieve optimal performance.

   This draft outlines the modeling of an optical pluggable within a
   host packet device in context of a packet over optical network.  The
   model presented in this document consolidates various properties of
   optical pluggables into three key functional block:

   *  Photonic/Optical attributes: These attributes defines the
      characteristics of the optical and photonic properties such as
      spectrum, polarization, dispersion etc., which do not directly
      affect the behavior of the host packet device.

   *  Host/Electrical attributes: These attributes defines the
      characteristics of interconnect between the host and the optical
      pluggable, such as lane count, FEC etc., which both the optical
      pluggable and the packet host must understand and act upon.

   *  Physical and functional aspects of the pluggable (i.e.,
      equipment): This defines attributes of the optical pluggable
      itself, such as plug type, version, thermal characteristics, power
      consumption etc., which indirectly affect the packet host.

   For each of these functional blocks, coherent pluggable model
   provides attributes in following areas:

   *  Capabilities: These attributes are read-only and defines the
      functional capabilities of the optical pluggables.  They are
      defined in a profile called "operational-mode" and contains
      attributes such as modulation, bit-rate, baud-rate, chromatic-
      dispersion, polarization, FEC etc.  Generally an optical pluggable
      might support multiple operational-modes.

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             June 2024


   *  Configurations: Since an optical pluggable can support multiple
      operational-modes, these read-write attributes configure the
      pluggables to be functional in one of those operational- modes.
      Example of configuration attributes are output power, central
      frequency and operational-mode.

   *  States and performance monitoring telemetry data: These read-only
      attributes will be generated by optical pluggables and represents
      various states of the optical pluggable such as channel input
      power, channel output power, central frequency, laser temperature,
      current OSNR etc.  In most cases these attributers are changing
      with time and pluggable reports instantaneous, min , max, average
      values.

   *  Alarm notifications

   Both vendor-agnostic and vendor-specific attributes are important
   considerations in the modeling of coherent pluggables.

   The document is divided into the following sections:

   *  Section 3: Optical Pluggable in a Device with Packet Functions

   *  Section 4: Coherent Pluggables Building Blocks

   *  Section 5: Coherent Pluggables Data Modeling

   *  Section 6: Coherent Pluggables Yang Model

   *  Section 7: Coherent pluggable Gap Analysis

   *  Section 8: Coherent Pluggables Manifest

   *  Section 9: Optical Pluggables Lifecycle Management

   *  Section 10: Functional Architecture Implications

   *  Section 11: Usage of Coherent Pluggables Manifest

3.  Optical Pluggable in a Device with Packet Functions

   Figure 1 shows a packet device from vendor X, which is connected to
   optical device, equipped with optical pluggables from vendor X and Y.
   This figure exposes the following internal and external interfaces:

   1.  This interface provides the control of packet device packet and
       optical functions.  It provides these functions which can be
       decoupled such that there is no overlap between the optical and
       packet control functions.

   2.  The optical controller has read/write access to the optical
       network

   3.  The CMIS (content management interoperability services)
       communication interface between hosts (e.g., packet devices) and
       optical pluggable

   4.  The data flow between the coherent pluggable and the packet data
       function through this interface.  This is electrical interface
       between coherent pluggable and the host.  Section 4 will discuss
       this in more details.

   5.  Optical fiber connecting the optical devices to optical
       pluggables.  This carries the flow of photonic signal from the
       optical device to the coherent pluggables.  Section 4 will
       discuss this in more details.

   This draft presents the modeling of the coherent pluggable such as #1
   and #2 in Figure 1 within a host packet device.  The model presented
   in Section 5 consolidates properties of coherent pluggable on
   interfaces (4) and (5) where interface (5) provides the photonic/
   optical attributes and interface provides the host/electrical
   attributes.

4.  Coherent Pluggable Functional Building Blocks

   The functional building blocks of the coherent pluggables of Figure 1
   are shown in Figure 2 and has three major functions:

   *  Media side: This functional block represents all Photonic/Optical
      attributes of the coherent pluggables (interface (5) in Figure 1).
      These attributes define the characteristics of the optical and
      photonic properties such as spectrum, polarization, dispersion
      etc., which do not directly affect the behavior of the host packet
      device.

   The media side of the coherent pluggable is further divided into two
   functional blocks; Optical Channel/OTSI and Media Logical Channels.
   The characterises of the Optical channel/OTSI are:

   *  This is the optical network facing interfaces

   *  Represents the digital wrapper that transports services over a
      wavelength

   *  Represents the wavelength and the coherent aspects of the signal
      modulated onto it baud-rate, bit-rate, modulation scheme,
      frequency, tx-power, etc.

   *  Optical signal FEC termination/source, FEC characteristic
      information – configuration, if possible, Pre-FEC BER, Post-FEC
      BER, fail/degrade thresholds, raw corrected/uncorrected counts

   *  Provides configuration of the signal and monitoring capabilities

   *  Provides monitoring capabilities in the Tx (toward fiber/medium)
      and Rx (from fiber/medium) directions, Total optical power,
      optical channel power, Coherent statistics

4.2.  Media Logical Channels

   The characterises of the Media Logical Channels are:

   *  Logical representation of the hierarchical view of the digital
      framing layers used for transport of services over the wavelength

   *  Provides access to information for configuration and monitoring
      characteristics.  For example, for 400ZR/OpenZR+, it represents
      the 400ZR frame structure in which Ethernet services are mapped
      and for an OTN encapsulated signal, it represents the OTU, ODU,
      OPU frame structures, perhaps with a multi-layer multiplex
      structure, in which Ethernet and other types of services are
      mapped

4.3.  Host Logical Channels

   The host side of the coherent pluggable is further divided into two
   functional blocks; Host Logical Channels and Electrical channels.
   The characteristics of the Host Logical Channels are:

   *  Logical representation of the hierarchical view of the digital
      framing layers for services carried on the electrical lanes of the
      device

   *  Provides information for configuration and monitoring
      characteristics of each service

   *  Represents each service carried over the media logical channel and
      optical interface/wavelength, e.g., 25GE, 50GE, 100GE, 200GE,
      400GE, OTU4, OTUCn etc.

4.4.  Electrical Channels

   The characteristics of the Electrical Channels are:

   *  The host interface lanes of the device forming the physical
      interface to the host platform data path device(s)

   *  Lanes grouped to support the type/format and bandwidth of the
      signal used for a service

   *  Provides information for configuration and monitoring
      characteristics of the signal for a service in the electrical
      domain, e.g., Interface-format, FEC, alarming thresholds, etc.

   *  Provides monitoring capabilities in the Tx (toward fiber) and Rx
      (from the fiber)

4.5.  Equipment

   The "Equipment functional block" in Figure 2 represents the coherent
   pluggable itself and has the following characteristics:

   *  Provides manufacturer identification information for the device

   *  Advertises capabilities of the device including capabilities for
      the host/client interface and the media/line interface

   *  Provides monitoring capabilities of physical characteristics and
      health of the device, e.g., temperature, voltage, coherent
      transmitter/receiver characteristics

   *  Provides for configuration where applicable – e.g., of device
      environmental thresholds

   *  Supports device level capabilities such as firmware installation,
      restarts, etc.

5.  Optical Pluggables Data Modeling

   The attributes of all functional building block of a coherent
   pluggable in Figure 2 will be exposed to external packet and optical
   controllers via host interface (1) shown in Figure 1.  To this end,
   we need to model the coherent pluggable building blocks described in
   Section 4.

   The data modelling of each functional blocks provides attributes in
   five areas:

   1.  Coherent pluggable capabilities (aka supported-modes)

   2.  Coherent pluggable configurations

   3.  Coherent pluggable states and performance monitoring data

   4.  Coherent pluggable threshold definition

   5.  Coherent pluggable alarm notifications

5.1.  Coherent pluggable capabilities (i.e., supported-modes)

   The supported-modes are read-only capability attributes that define
   the functional capabilities of coherent pluggables.  In other words,
   the coherent pluggable functional capabilities are described by a set
   of supported-modes, which includes read-only attributes such as
   modulation, bit rate, baud rate, chromatic dispersion, polarization,
   and FEC.  For some attributes it includes value range (min. max) as
   well.  A coherent pluggable may support multiple supported-modes,
   where each mode can be defined by one of the following methods:

   *  STANDARD: Defined by a Standards Developing Organization (SDO)
      such as ITU-T

   *  NON-STANDARD: Defined by a forum such as Optical Internetworking
      Forum (OIF), OpenConfig or by an individual vendor or by an
      operator

   The STANDARD defined supported-modes are well-known capabilities
   established by standard bodies such as ITU-T [G.698.2].  These modes
   are recognized and supported by coherent pluggables, routers, and SDN
   controllers.  While the current specification references ITU-T
   [G.698.2], this document will support the work of other Standards
   Development Organizations (SDOs) as their specifications become
   available.

   In contrast, the NON-STANDARD defined supported-modes are
   capabilities specified by forums such as OIF [OIF-400ZR], OpenConfig,
   or by individual vendors.  These supported-modes might not be
   supported by all coherent-pluggables, routers or SDN controllers.  In
   specific, the supported-modes defined by an individual vendor might
   be not be recognized and supported by any routers and SDN
   controllers.

   As illustrated in Figure 3," this document employs a consistent data
   structure for defining STANDARD and NON-STANDARD supported-modes
   where each supported-mode contains:

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             June 2024


   *  supported-mode-id: ID of the supported mode.

   *  organization-id: The authority that defines the supported-mode,
      such as ITU-T, OIF, OpenConfig, or a vendor.  This provides a name
      space for an authority who defines the supported-mode.

   *  supported-mode-type: The type of supported-mode which is STANDARD
      or NON-STANDARD

   *  multiple tags: Optional tags that can be used for various
      purposes, mainly for future extensibility.  For example, these
      tags can map the supported-mode to CMIS Media-ID.  Other potential
      uses of this tag are reserved for future developments.

   *  operational-mode: This is the main part of this document which
      contains a list of capability attributes supported by the coherent
      pluggable.

   Some details of supported modes can be found in IETF draft
   [Impairment].

   Section 8 discusses the concept of the "coherent pluggable manifest",
   which is a repository for all supported-modes" either STANDARD or
   NON-STANDARD.  It also outlines the benefit of such repository and
   various use-cases.

5.2.  Coherent pluggable configurations attributes

   The coherent pluggables support a set of read-write attributes which
   are configurable.  Example of such configuration attributes are
   output power, central frequency and operational-mode.  Note that
   since a coherent pluggable may support multiple operational-modes
   (standard or custom), the read-write operational-mode attribute
   programs the coherent pluggable to be functional in one of those
   operational-modes.

5.3.  Coherent pluggable states and performance monitoring data

   These read-only attributes will be generated by optical pluggables
   and represents various states and performance monitoring data of the
   optical pluggable such as channel input power, channel output power,
   central frequency, laser temperature, current OSNR etc.  In most
   cases these attributers are temporal and coherent pluggable reports
   values such as instantaneous, min, max and average.  A "supported
   threshold profile (STP) can be assigned to each performance
   monitoring data (see Section 5.4).

5.4.  Coherent pluggable threshold definition

   To provide a general solution for threshold definition of coherent
   pluggable performance monitoring data, the concept of "Supported
   Threshold Profile (STP)" is introduced.  As shown in Figure 4, each
   STP defines upper and lower threshold levels, threshold style and
   variety of PM metrics such as minimum, maximum and average values.

     (Note: these are just a few examples)

             Figure 4: Coherent pluggable threshold definition

   To define the upper and lower thresholds for performance monitoring
   telemetry data, operator should set upper and lower limits that
   delineate acceptable performance ranges.  This ensures that any
   deviations can be quickly identified and addressed.  A rolling window
   between min-time and max-time should be employed to dynamically
   adjust these thresholds based on recent data trends, providing a more
   accurate reflection of current network conditions.  By continuously
   updating the thresholds, network performance can be maintained within
   optimal parameters, reducing the risk of undetected issues.

   A variety of performance monitoring metrics, including minimum,
   maximum, average, and instantaneous values, can be collected.  These
   metrics offer a comprehensive view of performance fluctuations,
   allowing for precise monitoring and quicker response times to
   anomalies.  Minimum and maximum values help identify the extremes of
   performance, while average values give a sense of typical performance
   levels.  Instantaneous values, on the other hand, provide real-time
   insights, which are crucial for immediate issue detection and
   resolution.  This multi-faceted approach ensures that network
   performance is consistently monitored and maintained at high
   standards.

   For each performance monitoring state data, one STP should be
   assigned.

5.5.  Coherent plug alarm notifications

   [Editor's note: To be added in a later release.]

   The coherent pluggables might generate various alarm notifications
   due to the various reasons.

6.  Optical Pluggables Yang Model

   [Editor's note: To be added in a later release.]

7.  Coherent pluggable data modelling gap analysis

   [Editor's note: To be added in a later release.]

   This activity was initiated to examine existing IETF models related
   to pluggables for "completeness":

   *  To assess existing properties/structures

   *  To look for missing properties/structures

   It is recognized that there is uncompleted work on properties in
   other bodies so this activity will be ongoing.  The aim is to achieve
   best positioning of the IETF work with respect to the other related
   activities in the industry.

   To carry out this ongoing examination, Properties/structures from
   relevant external bodies are collected and compared with properties/
   structures present in IETF models related to pluggables.  Where
   properties/structures differ the differences are examined and
   justifications considered.  Where there is justification for changes
   to the IETF models these are proposed.

8.  Coherent Pluggable Manifest

   Referring to Section 5.1, the coherent pluggable capability
   attributes (i.e., supported-modes) are crucial aspects of coherent
   pluggables and should be easily accessible by anyone for various
   activities, including:

   *  Network Engineers: Need to know the capabilities and
      characteristics of any coherent pluggable whether the coherent
      pluggable is already deployed or will potentially be installed and
      deployed in their network



Rokui, et al.           Expires 30 December 2024               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             June 2024


   *  SDN Controllers: The optical, packet or higher-layer SDN
      controllers need to have detailed knowledge of the coherent
      pluggables for various reasons such as the assessment of the
      viability of any photonic services from plug-to-plug,
      configuration and fulfilment of the coherent pluggables and
      others.

   *  Packet Device (e.g., Router): Optionally the host packet device
      can also access the "coherent pluggable manifest" to provide
      details of coherent pluggables already installed in packet
      devices.

   The term "Coherent Pluggable Manifest" is used for the collection of
   information, appropriately structured and interrelated, that
   describes the capabilities of a pluggable.  In other terminology
   spaces the Manifest may be considered to be a Specification, a
   Profile, etc.

   It should be noted that any equipment could have a Manifest
   describing its capabilities and the Manifest may be broken down into
   units that can be referenced and reused, i.e., the definition can be
   modular.

   To facilitate the stages, each vendor would be expected to provide a
   Manifest for each pluggable type & version.

   Considering the above, it appears reasonable that all pluggable
   capabilities whether they be proprietary or standard should be fully
   described in the Manifest.  This may be achieved by a reference to a
   standard that is itself fully defined in machine interpretable form.
   This approach would allow for a far more flexible and future-proofed
   control solution.

   To facilitate easy access to coherent pluggable attributes, the
   details of coherent pluggable operational-modes are collected in a
   public repository, such as GitHub and SharePoint, called "Coherent
   Pluggable Manifest".  This machine-readable repository can be read
   and interpreted easily by any SDN controller, operator, or other
   devices in the network.

   Figure 5 illustrates the overall structure of the "Coherent Pluggable
   Manifest".  It contains several operational-mode records where each
   record includes all the capability attributes for a pair of
   [organization-id, operational-mode].  As discussed in Section 5.1,
   "organization-id" refers to any authority that defines them such as
   ITU-T [G.698.2] or [OIF-400ZR]) or a vendor.

   Each record in the coherent pluggable manifest is machine readable/
   interpretable and is uniquely identified by a tuple [organization-id,
   operational-mode].

   Using "Coherent Pluggable Manifest", the format and usage of STANDARD
   or NON-STANDARD operational-modes is the same.  Note that all
   attributes pertaining to operational-modes are defined by this IETF
   document.

    Coherent Pluggable Manifest
      - Contains one or more operational-mode records
      - Each record for tuple [organization-id, operational-mode]
      - It is machine-readable/interpretable

                   Figure 5: Coherent Pluggable Manifest

   In essence, the introduction of the concept of "Coherent pluggable
   manifest" substantially streamlines the definition and application of
   these modes, encompassing both STANDARD and NON-STANDARD operational-
   mode.

   Below a few examples are provided to demonstrate the concept of the
   "Coherent Pluggable Manifest".  Figure 6 illustrates the content of a
   manifest record for NON-STANDARD operational-mode 0x3E which is
   defined by OIF forum.  In practice this operational mode is supported
   by almost all coherent pluggables.  The detail information for this
   operational-mode can be found at [SFF8024] Table 4-7.

   "Figure 8" presents an example where the Vendor-Y has a coherent
   pluggable module with NON-STANDARD operational-mode 0x22 as well.  In
   this scenario, the organization associated with the pluggable module
   is Vendor-Y, which defined the same operational-mode 0x22 as "Vendor-
   X"

   It is important to note that while the operational-modes in both
   Figure 7 and Figure 8 share the same values, they are defined by
   different vendors.  Consequently, these operational-modes are not
   related and may differ significantly in their attributes.  In other
   words, although the semantics of these modes are identical, their
   actual content might vary significantly.  This is one of the reasons
   that any record in Coherent Pluggable Manifest is uniquely identified
   by tuple [organization-id, operational-mode].

9.  Optical Pluggables Lifecycle Management

   This section discusses the complete lifecycle of an optical pluggable
   as shown in Figure 9.  It includes discussion on the pre-purchase
   evaluation of pluggables through installation to the operation of a
   pluggable in a live network.

   Most of this lifecycle discussion applies to a majority of equipment
   types.  Where the pluggable is special, this is highlighted.

   The figure below provides a high level flow.  In a real environment,
   all stages will be running in parallel for various plug versions etc.
   and there may be feedback from any stage to a previous stage.  For
   example, the research, evaluation and planning exercises are ongoing
   activities that continue as the network grows and changes and as new
   pluggable type & versions are introduced by vendors and insight from
   deployment may feed back to the evaluation stage.

   Throughout the lifecycle specific use cases and scenarios will be
   considered and applied.  These will be developed during the early
   stages and applied in service design.

   Note: The stages and the terminology used are not intended to reflect
   any specific operational practice.  They are intended to be neutral
   with respect to any existing operator's processes, aligning with the
   essence of the processes.

9.1.  Approving the pluggable type and version

   Pluggables, like all equipment, are carefully chosen.  A network
   operations company (the operator) will decide what pluggables to use
   in the network based upon research and an understanding of
   capabilities of the pluggables available in the marketplace.  These
   capabilities will be considered against the specific applications,
   use cases and scenarios that are of relevance to the operator's
   business.

   It is expected that these applications, use cases and scenarios will
   be developed through "Market research" and as pluggables etc. are
   assessed.  The use cases and scenarios will be applied extensively in
   later stages.

   The operator will acquire samples of each type & version of pluggable
   of interest and probably test and then trial them.  They will also
   probably carry out "type approval" considering each type&version of
   pluggable for a particular set of applications (where those
   applications may be defined by the operator themselves or may be
   standardized definitions) etc.  The full detail of the capability of
   each type & version of pluggable is relevant at all of these stages
   (see Section 9.5).  The capabilities are expected to be expressed in
   a Manifest (see Section 8).

   The market analysis will lead to Service type design (some of which
   will be innovative) and will lead to an understanding of potential
   revenue.  This revenue prediction will be considered when evaluating
   price and compatibility such that initial sketches of use can be
   constructed.

9.2.  Planning the network

   Specific pluggables (type&version) will be purchased only after
   detailed planning of the network.  To carry out this planning, full
   knowledge of each type&version of pluggable will be required.  The
   planning process will account for key pluggable properties to explore
   viability and compatibility.  The planning will use predictions of
   "service demand" (e.g., using a demand matrix) and hence
   infrastructure need to determine purchase volumes, phasing etc.

   The exercise may result in identification of several type & versions
   of pluggable that can be interchanged for a particular specific
   purpose.  Clearly, pluggable pricing will also be accounted for in
   this phase.  Again, during this stage of the lifecycle the full
   detail of the Manifest for each type & version of pluggable is
   relevant.




Rokui, et al.           Expires 30 December 2024               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             June 2024


   During the "Network planning" process different types of service
   relevant for the applications, use cases and scenarios (identified in
   Section 9.1) will be explores and specific approaches to realizing
   each resulting type of service will be determined.  This will result
   in design of specific "service realization" patterns and templates
   that will be used in later stages of the process.  The approach to
   deploying each service type is defined for each operational context
   (application etc.)

   As a result of the planning exercise, numbers of each pluggable
   type&version required will be known and purchasing can be initiated.
   The purchased pluggables will be added to the inventory and spares
   holdings.

9.3.  Dealing with service demand

   The planning exercise leads to optical infrastructure requirements
   with some timetable for deployment.  The "Optical infrastructure" is
   designed (using the patterns/templates designed in Section 9.2.  The
   infrastructure will be deployed as appropriate based upon predicted
   and actual service demand etc.

   When optical "services demand" is received, perhaps to provide
   underlay for the packet network or driven by a specific service
   contract, optical network analysis is carried out to evaluate how to
   efficiently and effectively achieve the specific service demanded.
   This analysis will consider the whole optical network including the
   plugs and ROADMs etc.  In most cases this "Service design" will use
   patterns/templates constructed in Section 9.2 in conjunction with
   relevant capability information for the pluggable type&version.

   Prior to progressing further it is important to note that pluggables
   are highly valuable, and correspondingly expensive.  They are
   deployed in a controlled fashion.  There are a range of policies for
   deployment of pluggables.

   In some cases, at one extreme end of the range of policy choices, an
   operator may decide to fully populate a packet device with a
   selection of pluggables and may cable them to adjacent ROADMS.
   However, it is more likely that pluggable deployment will be on a
   just-in-time basis, at the other end of the range of policy choices,
   so a pluggable is not deployed (and hence is not cabled) until the
   solution to realization of the optical service has been determined.

   Regardless of the pluggable deployment approach, the pluggable
   capability will be accounted for in the optical network analysis
   activity.  Where pluggables are present, the range of installed
   pluggables constrain the possible realizations, where the pluggables



Rokui, et al.           Expires 30 December 2024               [Page 23]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             June 2024


   have not been deployed all approved pluggables (type&version) could
   be considered during the analysis, although capability of the
   relevant packet devices to support specific pluggables will also need
   to be considered, and this may eliminate some pluggables.  In
   addition, if there is some urgency, the availability of the type of
   pluggable to the installation engineer and/or in the local spares
   holding inventory may also be considered.

   The optical design will be "validated" in terms of "viability" and
   compatibility prior to proceeding.  This analysis takes into account
   the full definitions of the pluggable type&versions of interest,
   where each is defined in a corresponding and referenced manifest.

9.4.  Installing and operationalising the pluggable

   Once the design is available, any necessary physical installation
   exercise (pluggable installation, cabling etc.) is carried out,
   driven by "Work orders" that identify the type&version of pluggable
   to instal etc.

   On detection of the pluggable instance, the control system will
   validate that the work order has been carried out correctly.  To do
   this, the full type&version of the pluggable is read and compared
   with the intent.  Where there are discrepancies, either a work order
   is constructed to correct the installation error after the detected
   pluggable type&version is evaluated for compatibility with the
   specific design.  This evaluation is done using the Manifest for that
   type&version.  It is possible that the type&version may be acceptable
   although perhaps a little more expensive than the optimum choice etc.

   Once the type&version of pluggable has been confirmed, the cabling to
   the pluggable will be validated and the service set up and validated.
   Depending upon the operator practices, there may be an extensive
   service test phase prior to handing over the service.  The service
   may not be enabled immediately, but will be at some point after which
   the service will become operational.  From this point on, normal live
   service/equipment management/control will be active.

   Beyond this point normal operational activities such as engineering
   works, restoration, upgrade, fault location etc. will be carried out.
   Clearly, there is also the reverse sequence which includes
   deactivating a service and removing the plug and there are also
   various edits and refinements that result from changes in demand and
   changes in understanding of the service needs etc.  These steps have
   not been covered at this stage as the initial list above is
   sufficient to the develop a deep understanding of the control of the
   plugs.  Further stages will be added in a future version of this
   document.

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             June 2024


   In addition, during transition towards a more automated future, there
   are processes related to discovery of existing network etc.  In many
   of these processes the current state of the network is understood
   including the type&version of each pluggable.  Some degree of
   understanding of capability of pluggables (and any other equipment)
   is relevant.  The approach using manifests appears appropriate to
   gain this understanding.

9.5.  Expressing capabilities

   As highlighted above, prior to installation of an optical pluggable
   in a device (with packet functions etc.), various research, approval,
   planning and design activities must be carried out (as they would be
   for any hardware).  All of these activities will require information
   on the capabilities of the pluggable.

   Detailed information on the capability of the pluggable is required
   long before it is installed and operating.  This points to the need
   for a model of capability (of a type of pluggable) that is
   independent of the model of a running instance (and hence points to
   decoupling of the model of capability from the model of the operation
   of the pluggable).  This also suggest that discovery of capability
   detail from the pluggable is not sufficient/appropriate for
   deployment (although it may be useful in a lab context).

   A machine interpretable definition/specification for the pluggable
   should be available (independent of the pluggable instance) for each
   pluggable type&version where the statement of type&version (complete
   type&version) used is to the degree sufficient to precisely identify
   the relevant (unique) definition/specification.  The complete
   type&version may include hardware type&version, firmware type&version
   and software type&version details (where the firmware/software
   influences the operation/control of the pluggable).  This is
   essentially the type&version used when considering spares holding and
   like-for-like replacement in the field.

   From this perspective, all that is required from a running pluggable
   is to report the complete type&version detail so that this can be
   confirmed as the right type&version.  The type&version can be used to
   reference the relevant unique specification.

   It is important to clarify the definition of capability.  In this
   document, the term capability means "A quality or facility that
   enables something to carry out some activity and/or take some role".
   In the context of an equipment, the term applies to its functional
   and physical properties.





Rokui, et al.           Expires 30 December 2024               [Page 25]

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             June 2024


   Considering a pluggable (as for many other equipments), this would
   include specification of capabilities such as:

   *  physical size, form factor and shape (the capability to fit in a
      particular type of location)

   *  connector type (the capability to physically interconnect with a
      compatible connector)

   *  bus architecture (the capability to communicate with a compatible
      component)

   *  optical termination characteristics (the functional capabilities
      emergent from the powered physical equipment, allowing
      interconnection with corresponding compatible functions)

   *  measurement opportunities (the functional capabilities to provide
      information to various control functions)

   A capability statement may be a precise single value with no
   uncertainty, a range, a collection of related ranges and thresholds
   etc.  Where some aspect has variability or is controllable, this is
   also required to be specified.

   For an equipment to be understood and used by a control system, the
   detailed information on capabilities must be available in machine
   interpretable form (to the degree necessary for any particular
   function to be carried out).  The machine interpretable statements
   may be in the form of software, but preferably should be in the form
   of data (information) that can be readily ingested by tooling and
   ideally in a standardised language.

   Traditionally, the published statements of capability have been in
   somewhat ambiguous text that require interpretation and conversion
   into a machine interpretable form through a manual intermediate step
   (normally performed, with errors and performed many times for any
   particular device type etc.).  It is suggested here that the best
   source of the machine interpretable data is the specifying authority
   (e.g., ITU-T for standard applications, the vendor for plug
   capabilities, an operator for non-standard applications).

Internet-Draft        Modelling Optical Pluggables             June 2024


9.6.  Dealing with proprietary capabilities

   Where the pluggable offers proprietary capabilities, it is possible
   that there are proprietary properties available from the pluggable
   control interface to the packet device.  These properties may be
   expressed, on the device interface to the controller, in data
   conforming to a proprietary definition stated in YANG.  For the
   packet device to be able to express the proprietary properties it
   needs the YANG augment files, the pluggable control interface
   definition and a mapping definition (where that provides the details
   of the transforms necessary to generate the exposed property from the
   information provided by the pluggable).

   In an ideal realization of the control solution, the controller could
   provide the packet device with the YANG augment definition, and the
   mapping definition in such a way that this could be run by generic
   software on the packet device requiring no change to the software of
   the packet device.

   This approach could also be taken to cater for enhancements to the
   standard YANG including mappings from proprietary properties on the
   pluggable and new standard properties in the device interface to the
   controller.

   Some proprietary capability statements may be commercially sensitive.
   It would be quite reasonable to encrypt the related capability
   statements allowing for them to be passed to a specific vendor
   control component without being observed or interpreted in any way by
   other control components (from other vendors).  There may be a
   requirement for an NDA to enable access to the data.  This NDA can be
   used to gate the delivery of this commercially sensitive encrypted
   information.  The encrypted information may be passed via a special
   secure channel directly to a component authorized to decrypt the
   information into machine interpretable form and use it.

10.  Implications for the Functional Control Architecture

   [Editor's note: To be added in a later release.]

   The following section considers the interaction sequence, resulting
   from the pluggable lifecycle analysis, within the functional control
   architecture and highlights resulting adjustments to the control
   functionality.  Note that this section does not deal with the
   physical realization of the control components of the functional
   architecture other than those dependent on the device and pluggable
   physical boundaries.

11.  Usage of Coherent Pluggables Manifest

   Within this section, we present a few use-cases showcasing the
   practical application of the coherent pluggable manifest.

11.1.  Coherent Pluggables Manifest Example-1

   The first example is illustrated in Figure 10.  This is a simple
   example where the packet over optical network has been already
   provisioned with both optical underlay and packet overlay services.
   The role of SDN controller is just to discover and manage the
   network.  In other words, the SDN controller was not involved in
   various aspects of service provisioning and viability.  The second
   example will come all these aspects in more detail.

   In this example, all optical and IP/MPLS services had been already
   provisioned and deployed and the packet over optical network is fully
   functional.

   Within packet devices R1 and R2, coherent pluggables p1 and p2, are
   installed, interfacing through ports port_a and port_b, respectively.
   Both coherent pluggables are provisioned for the following
   operational-mode.

   *  [organization-id, operational-mode] = [OIF, 0x3E]

   A single photonic service is established between these pluggables and
   an IP link is mapped to this L0 photonic service.  The overlay TE-
   Tunnel-1 and L3 service-1 had been also provisioned.  The following
   steps outline the details of how this network is discovered and
   managed by SDN controllers (note that the SDN controller was not
   involved in provisioning):

   *  Packet devices (R1, R2), pluggables (p1, p2), and photonic devices
      (m1, m2, m3) are all discovered by SDN controllers.

   *  The SDN controller also discovers all underlay and overlay
      services, i.e., L0 service-1, IP link-1, TE-Tunnel-1 and L3
      servcie-1.

   *  The SDN controller has the network inventory, including coherent
      pluggables p1 and p2.  In particular for coherent pluggables,
      basic information such as pluggable type, vendor, manufacturer,
      serial number and software version will be provided by pluggables
      to SDN controller.

   *  The inventory of packet devices R1 and R2 contains the
      configurations of pluggable attributes such as "configured
      operational-mode," "configured central frequency," and "configured
      output power".

   *  Specifically, using the basic information of pluggables p1 and p2
      such as pluggable type, vendor, manufacturer, serial number and
      software version collected earlier from packet devices R1 and R2,
      the SDN controller can use the "Coherent Pluggable Manifest," to
      access the entire information of both pluggables p1 and p2.  This
      includes all supported operational-modes along with all attributes
      related to each supported operational-mode.

   *  The SDN controller can collect all PM telemetry data from the
      network (including pluggables).

   *  The SDN controller can collect all alarm notifications from the
      network (including pluggables).

   *  The SDN controller can further change, modify, optimize the
      network (if needed).

11.2.  Coherent Pluggables Manifest Example-2

   The example in Figure 11 demonstrates the usage of the "Coherent
   Pluggable Manifest" for entire lifecycle of photonic service from
   including service planning, viability, provisioning, collection of PM
   telemetry, collection of alarm notifications and optimization.

   Note that the packet over optical network in Figure 11 is not created
   yet.  The ports port_a and port_b of packet device R1 and R2 are
   empty and can accept coherent pluggables.  In addition, ports port_a
   and port_b are not connected to the optical network yet, i.e., there
   is no connection between packet devices R1, R2 and optical network.
   The port_a and port_b of packet device R1 and R2 can be potentially
   connected to any photonic nodes m1, m2 or m3.

   Operator's goal is to use the SDN controller to plan, provision and
   monitor an optimal IP link-2 between packet devices R1 and R2.
   Optionally they can also provision overlay TE-Tunnel-2 and L3
   service-2.  To achieve this, the SDN controller should first plan an
   optical service-2, perform the viability to make sure this photonic
   service is feasible, provision it and then map it to an IP link-2.

   two operational-modes.  Note that the detail information of these
   operational-modes including all optical and photonic attributes are
   already uploaded to "Coherent Pluggable Manifest" by Vendor-X and

   The following steps outline the details of how this network is
   planned, provisioned, discovered and managed by SDN controllers:

   *  At first, there are no coherent pluggables installed in the packet
      devices yet.  There are also no connection between packet devices
      and optical network.

   *  All packet devices (R1, R2) and photonic devices (m1, m2, m3) are
      managed by the SDN controller.

   *  As a result, the SDN controller maintains an inventory of packet
      and photonic devices within the network (i.e., nodes R1, R2, m1,
      m2, m3).

   *  To create the IP link-2, the SDN controller should plan and then
      provision the optical service-2 between port_a and port_b.

   *  To this end, the SDN controller should first design an optical
      service and then performs the viability check to make sure the
      optical service is viable in this network.

   *  So, the SDN controller calculates the best optical path from
      port_a to port_b.

   *  Next, the SDN controller performs the viability on optical route
      to make sure the optical path is viable in the network.

   *  To do viability, the SDN controller checks all attributes of all
      operational-modes to find the most optimal operational-mode.  To
      do this, the SDN controller connects to the "Coherent Pluggable
      Manifest" and access all optical and photonic attributes of all
      operational-modes (such as chromatic dispersion, FEC, modulation,
      polarization mode dispersion etc.) and performs the viability.

   *  After performing the optical path calculation and optical
      viability, the SDN controller selects the best coherent pluggable
      to be installed on port_a and port_b and the best optical route
      from port_a to port_b.

   *  Upon completion of the photonic viability check, the SDN
      controller determines which photonic devices (m1, m2, m3) should
      be connected to ports port_a and port_b.

   *  The SDN controller informs the operator of the selected coherent
      pluggables for ports port_a and port_b and provides instructions
      on how to connect them to the respective photonic devices (m1, m2,
      m3).

   *  The operator installs the designated pluggables into ports port_a
      and port_b and connects them to the specified photonic devices.

   *  The SDN controller then manages the newly installed pluggables.

   *  As part of the photonic viability process, the SDN controller
      knows the specific attributes of the pluggables, including
      "configured operational mode," "configured central frequency," and
      "configured output power."

   *  As a result, the SDN controller configures these configurations to
      each pluggable on port_a and port_b

   *  The SDN controller should also configure optical nodes m1, m2, m3
      with attributes such as output power.

   *  The SDN controller provisions the optical service_1 between two
      conheret pluggables on port_a and port_b.

   *  The SDN controller also provisions the IP link-2 between packet
      device R1 and R2.

   *  The SDN controller can collect all PM telemetry data from the
      network (including pluggables).

   *  The SDN controller can collect all alarm notifications from the
      network (including pluggables).

   *  The SDN controller can further change, modify, optimize the
      network (if needed).
